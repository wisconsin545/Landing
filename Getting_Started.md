#Lending club loan parser
This is an engine to parse both lending club loans and secondary market notes.

##Install
`Npm install` should be everything you need.
(Go to this [link] to install Node JS and NPM (https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm))

##After install
You need a Lending club account in order for this application to run. After you have an api key and account key, create a file called `config.json` in the base directory. The file should look similar to:

	
~~~~
{
	"apiKey": "VIrJWnJAuY52AWr+nnyXPl8the4=",
	"accountKey": "146571104"
}
~~~~


##Run
To run the loan parser `node index.js`.

To run the notes parser `npm start`
