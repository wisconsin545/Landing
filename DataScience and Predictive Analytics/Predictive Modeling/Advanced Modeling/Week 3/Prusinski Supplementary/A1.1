 str(wine)
# This function gives a helpful metadata statement for the dataset.
 summary(wine)
# This numerical output is helpful, but a visualization would be better. 
 plot(wine)
# This function plotted all the variables against one another.

# While there is not a discernable patter, it can be seen preliminarily that
# a few of the variables are correlated with one another.

#This next portion of code highlights the basic makings of a scatterplot.
