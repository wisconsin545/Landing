1. Executive Summary 
This report details an assessment carried out during September 2012 into the situation 
facing Syrian refugees living in the community in Jordan. It follows on from the 
launching of a preliminary emergency appeal by IFRC and JRC in August 2012, which 
focuses on supporting JRC to scale up its assistance to Syrian refugees in the 
community. 

The assessment included six days of primary data collection in six locations in Jordan, 
as well as a detailed review of secondary data and extensive coordination meetings with 
other agencies and stakeholders. Current responses of JRC and UNHCR were also 
examined in detail. 

The assessment showed that many refugees living throughout Jordan, not just in the 
northern areas, face similar difficulties in providing for their basic needs. General 
findings were in line with secondary assessment data. 

Key findings 

• 
JRC has registered almost as many refugees as UNHCR, for the purposes of 
relief distributions; however there is a degree of overlap between the datasets, as 
well as between the beneficiary lists of local organizations under the JHCO 
umbrella. 
• 
A sizeable proportion of JRC-registered refugees are not registered with 
UNHCR, due to their concerns around privacy and protection. 
• 
The priority need of refugees who are living in the community is cash, to 
provide access to the market and meet basic household needs. Within this, rent is 
overwhelmingly the main need; followed by fresh food, medicines, items for 
babies and children, and items for winter. 
• 
Refugees do not face a food security problem, as there are continuing food aid 
and food voucher distributions; also refugees prioritise the cash they have to 
purchase food on the market. 
• 
Part of food aid is often re-sold by refugees, to generate cash for basic household 
expenditures. 
• 
Most refugees are renting their own accommodation, and many are unable to 
pay rent and utility costs, or are in debt to landlords for rent payments. 
• 
The housing rental market is tight, adequate accommodation is difficult for 
refugees to find, and rents have risen significantly in most areas. 
• 
Winter will bring higher utility costs, and refugees need cash to purchase 
heaters, fuel, blankets and warm clothes. 
• 
There are few reliable income sources for households. Income from work is 
consistently ranked below aid/charity, which is the primary income source. 
• 
Opportunities for refugees to work are limited, with only poorly paid informal 
work sometimes evidenced. This is particularly true outside of Amman. It was 
commonly reported around the country that some teenage children are working. 
• 
Savings are now very limited, with most refugees having depleted the resources 
they brought with them (including having sold assets). Refugees are often in 
debt, especially for rent. 
IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


• 
Access to health care and medicines is an issue mostly for those families who 
have a member with a chronic health condition, or an injury sustained in Syria, 
and who need additional or specialized care. 
• 
Education is not ranked as a top priority, and many refugee children are 
attending school; however some refugees cannot fund the cost of books, 
materials and uniforms. 
• 
Markets are functioning normally and have reacted to additional demand, with 
the exception of the housing market, as noted. 
• 
Refugees have received assistance from many organizations, especially local 
CBOs; however, this support seems to have peaked during Ramadan and is now 
more infrequent. 
Coping Strategies 
The main coping strategies which refugees are adopting to try and meet their basic 
needs and expenditures are as follows: 

• 
Dependency on aid, especially food distributions 
• 
Re-selling unwanted aid items on the market to generate cash 
• 
Incurring debt, especially to landlords for unpaid rent 
• 
Children engaging in informal work – generally adolescents, but reported as 
young as eleven 
• 
Women working informally, in domestic work (not widespread) 
• 
Men changing occupation and looking for any informal work available – but 
there are very limited opportunities outside of Amman 
• 
Begging – only hinted at in women’s focus groups 
• 
Reduction in meals from three per day to two – but not widespread 
Refugees are engaging in these coping strategies, but it is clear from the analysis of 
monthly expenditure needs and income sources that there is an income gap in many 
households. Many families are relying on a combination of aid, gifts, and cash 
generated by re-selling aid as their main income source. Whilst managing to achieve 
basic food security, the most vulnerable refugees cannot fund their other household 
costs; where they currently can, it is likely that many of these families will encounter 
difficulties in the coming months. Rent is a special issue – in order to maintain access to 
housing, some refugees need assistance to pay rent, and also to pay down debts to 
landlords, to remove the threat of eviction. 

The situation facing refugees living in the community is not expected to improve in the 
coming months, nor do refugees expect to be able to return to Syria. As such, these 
needs will persist for vulnerable families for the foreseeable future. 

Official Registration Status 
The UNHCR-registration status of refugees can be seen as indicating a degree of 
additional vulnerability. For those not registered, there is no free-of-charge access to the 
public health and education systems, or eligibility for WFP food voucher and UNHCR 
cash assistance. JRC has access to a large caseload of unregistered refugees, and this 
should be carefully considered as part of beneficiary selection for a future programme.

What Response is Justified? 
Further intervention to support the non-food basic expenditure of the most vulnerable 
refugee households is needed, as well as to prepare them for the coming winter. Several 
different response options to meet this objective are analysed in this report. An 
unconditional cash transfer is recommended as the best option1. 

All the necessary pre-conditions for cash transfer programming are met in Jordan in this 
current context. During the assessment, refugees gave a clear preference for cash over 
in-kind support. A number of cash payment mechanisms are available in Jordan, and 
security, corruption and gender issues do not present any major risks. Cash transfers are 
already being implemented by other agencies, and are seen as acceptable in Jordan. 
Most refugees are living in an urban context and have full access to markets to meet 
their needs. 

Details of the recommended cash transfer: 

• 
Unconditional – not tied to any expenditure, so allows refugees to prioritise their 
needs. 
• 
Recurring transfer – monthly for at least three months. This is because a one-off 
transfer will not have a material impact on the most vulnerable households. 
• 
Amount – calculated using the household expenditure data collected, at the level 
of average rent plus an additional amount for other priority needs. 
• 
Locations – where JRC has branches and has registered and conducted relief 
distributions for Syrians; locations also selected in coordination with other 
agencies who are implementing, or planning, cash assistance. 
• 
Targeting – most vulnerable households, according to the indicators identified in 
the report, including giving priority to refugees not registered with UNHCR. 
Coordination and avoiding duplication 

• 
Regular coordination with other agencies will be essential in order to avoid the 
duplication of cash assistance. This report contains a detailed mapping of 
relevant agency programmes and identifies potential overlaps. 
• 
JRC should apply to UNHCR to join the RAIS system, allowing cross-checking 
of UNHCR cash assistance beneficiaries against potential JRC beneficiaries, and 
removal of duplications. 
• 
The policy position around sharing of beneficiary data, as related to protection 
issues, will have to be agreed between JRC and other agencies. 
Other Recommendations 

• 
Improve data management within JRC by cleaning the existing beneficiary 
database, and collecting more vulnerability data from refugees through JRC’ 
ongoing relief distributions – to enable targeting to be done. Migration from MS 
Excel to MS Access will be necessary. 
• 
Use the cash programme as an opportunity for capacity building for JRC staff 
and volunteers, especially in disaster management principles and field work 
basics.

recommendations for a cash transfer programme, titled ‘Cash Assistance Programme Options’.

• 
Consider the need to include vulnerable Jordanians in programming as well as 
Syrians, to reduce potential resentment and improve acceptability. Any longer 
term interventions or extension of cash programming will need to do this. 
• 
A cash transfer will be simple to extend, either in duration or reach. This should 
be linked to persistent needs, and available funding.

2. Background 
Since the beginning of the unrest in Syria at the start of 2011, Jordan has received more 
Syrians fleeing the conflict than any neighbouring country. From March 2011, 
according to Government of Jordan figures, more than 190,000 Syrians have sought 
refuge in Jordan. Jordan has left its borders open to Syrians and has a favourable 
protection climate which has supported the population movement. 

Unlike Iraqi refugees who are concentrated in the capital Amman, Syrians have 
scattered throughout Jordan, with the largest concentrations in the border areas of Irbid 
and Mafraq governates and the capital Amman, as well as in other governates 
throughout the country. With the intensification of the conflict from July 2012 onwards, 
there has been a surge in the number of refugees. August witnessed a record number of 
arrivals, peaking at over 1,000 per day. 

To date, over 53,000 Syrians have been registered officially with UNHCR 2 . The 
Government of Jordan’s figure of 190,000 refugees is based on border statistics and 
other estimates. Almost 32,000 Syrians are in the newly established Za’atri camp in 
Mafraq, and a further 1,400 in King Abdullah Park and Cyber City refugee sites in the 
North. The population of Za’atri camp is increasing rapidly, as fast as the camp can be 
scaled up. 

However, the majority of Syrians are residing in urban or peri-urban host communities 
across the country. Although not all of them are in need, many arrived in Jordan with 
few, if any, resources, having depleted them while still in Syria or en-route to Jordan. 
The ability of the most vulnerable to make ends meet is limited. Accommodating them 
within local communities is putting pressure on national services and infrastructure, and 
the Government’s capacity to support them is approaching its limit. 

JRC has been responding to the needs of Syrian refugees since early 2012, focusing on 
the registering refugees around the country, and the distribution of food parcels and 
other relief items. During June 2012, IFRC and JRC carried out three rapid assessments 
in Jordan, covering Amman and the northern governates. They found much of the focus 
of the international community was on the refugee sites in the north, to the detriment of 
the host community context. On the back of this rapid assessment, the Regional 
Population Movement Preliminary Emergency Appeal was launched in August 2012, 
covering Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq. The majority of the Emergency Appeal covers 
Jordan - more specifically interventions to support Syrians residing in host 
communities. 

The British Red Cross seconded a delegate from its HES (Household Economic 
Security) roster during September 2012, to support IFRC/JRC in the start-up of the 
Emergency Appeal operation. The purpose of this deployment was to undertake a more 
detailed assessment to understand the needs and vulnerability of the refugees, as well as 
the evolving humanitarian response. Special focus was on developing the cash 
component in the Emergency Appeal – to support JRC in identifying criteria and an 
implementation strategy based on household economic security analysis, vulnerability 
factors and the current stages of the humanitarian response. This report is the first of

two, covering the assessment and broad response options. A second report will cover 
more detailed recommendations for a potential cash programme. 

3. Situation and Context 
3.1. Jordan 
Jordan is a low to middle income country with limited natural resources and a semi-arid 
climate. Approximately 75% (in the eastern region) is covered by the Arabian desert. 
Jordan is ranked 95th (out of 187 countries) in the Human Development Index, a 
classification of ‘medium’ development.3 

Food production, particularly of grains, is low. Domestic cereal production provides less 
than 3% of food and feed needs, so the country relies on food imports, and is heavily 
exposed to food price increases. Only 17% of the population lives in rural areas, and 
only 11% of Jordan’s land area is used for agriculture.4 Jordan is also completely reliant 
on imports for its energy needs. 

The Global Hunger Index (GHI)5 for Jordan in 2011 is defined as low. However, a 2008 
study by WFP and the GoJ6 highlighted some food insecurity in previously defined 
areas, known as ‘poverty pockets’, throughout the country. This found 8% food 
insecurity, 20% vulnerability, and 72% food security – with most of the food insecurity 
existing in the rural ‘poverty pockets’. 

According to the Jordan Human Development Report (UNDP, 2011), 13.3% of the 
population were defined as living below the poverty line in 2008. However, this figure 
does vary widely between governates (ranging from 8.3% in Amman to 31.9% in 
Mafraq). Department of Statistics data shows the unemployment rate in Jordan is high, 
12.9% in 2011. The cost of living in Jordan is significantly higher than in Syria, with 
some rough estimates putting it at double. 

Jordan faces a number of hazards such as earthquakes, flash floods and drought. 
However, earthquake and flood risk are ranked as low on the global risk index, while 
drought risk is ranked high.7 

Water scarcity in Jordan is a major and growing issue. Many urban areas have to make 
do with rationed piped municipal supply of 1-2 days per week. Present national water 
use already exceeds renewable freshwater resources by more than 20%.

Whilst prevailing public opinion has been open to the refugee influx, as numbers have 
continued to increase since July 2012 there are signs that this is starting to change, 
particularly in Mafraq, where the presence of Za’atri camp is having a negative impact 
on sentiment. A public opinion survey conducted in August 2012 in Jordan found that 
65% of respondents were against receiving more Syrian refugees, while 86% felt it was 
better for Syrians to be in camps and not in the community.8 

In a context of pre-existing poverty, unemployment, and rising living costs, it is clear 
that the refugee crisis has the potential to create social and economic pressure, as well as 
resentment among the poorer sections of the Jordanian community. 

3.2. Impact on Government of Jordan of the Refugee Influx 
The pressure on the GoJ budget and public service provision has been widely noted as 
the refugee crisis has worsened, especially water, energy, health, and education. 
Municipal services such as garbage collection, sanitation and drinking water, are also 
under pressure. Syrian refugees who are registered with UNHCR can access the public 
health and education system. The government also subsidies a number of basic goods in 
the open market, such as bread, cooking gas, fuel, electricity, and water, and these 
subsidies have been extended to Syrians. 

The GoJ has estimated that the cost of hosting a refugee population of 120,000 Syrians 
would cost the country about $123m annually to cover the increasing demand on basic 
services, plus an additional $46m annually for subsidies on basic goods for Syrians. 
These estimates were made in June 2012, and the number of refugees is now 
significantly higher.9 For a prolonged period of displacement, the GoJ forecasts that it 
would have to invest in capital items such as infrastructure, schools, and health 
facilities. 

In tandem with Jordan’s high budget deficit and high level of public debt, and the 
energy and water scarcity, it is clear that the refugee situation is placing mounting 
pressure on the Government’s ability to cope. In early September 2012 the GoJ 
announced that the influx is beyond what it can deal with, and is seeking $430m in 
donor support for its budget for the direct costs of hosting refugees.

• 
JRC has registered refugees in seven governates; UNHCR data covers twelve. 
• 
In all governates except for Irbid, JRC has registered more refugees than 
UNHCR. More than double the number of refugees have been registered in 
Amman. 
• 
A significant proportion of Syrian refugees registering with JRC are not 
registered with UNHCR. The proportion of those who are registered with 
UNHCR ranges from 30% to 59%, across the different governates11. This is due 
to a number of reasons including refugees’ concerns about their privacy and 
future security, an issue which will be discussed at length later under the 
assessment findings. However, refugees have felt comfortable to register their 
details with JRC, partly due to their awareness of the Red Crescent in Syria, and 
the perceived independence and neutrality of JRC. This factor is an important 
one which will be analysed later in this report. 
3.4. The Collective Aid Response in Jordan – Coordination and Duplication 
There has been a substantial response by local organisations in Jordan to the refugee 
situation. Many CBOs, among them Islamic organisations, have been active. Gulf Arab 
states have been providing support directly and through their local partners. Much 
assistance has been provided by local communities and individuals. Such efforts are 
laudable, but links between the international organisations and local organisations are 
poor, and coordination mechanisms are not functioning effectively. 

JHCO has been mandated by the Government to coordinate the activities of all local 
organisations, as well as to lead the operations in Za’tari camp. Under the umbrella of 
JHCO are numerous organisations; one of their largest implementing partners is Al 

11 JRC data, September 2012 – % of refugees who did not register with JRC with the UNHCR registration 
document, which is requested if refugees have it.

Kitabwal Sunnah, an Islamic organisation12. JHCO has reported that some $2.2m of 
food, NFI and cash assistance was channelled through local organisations between 
March-May 201213. The Islamic Center is another active organisation, but is outside the 
JHCO umbrella of local organisations. 

UNHCR is mandated to lead the international response in Jordan. UNHCR registration 
is a slow and centralised process, but it remains key for refugees to access government 
services as well as support from the UN system, which includes WFP as well as 
UNHCR itself.

combines the responses of UN agencies and some forty INGO partners. It has a 
planning horizon of March-December 2012. During September 2012 the RRP is under 
revision, due to the fact that the ‘worst case’ assumptions of refugee numbers in Jordan 
in the June RRP had already been seen by August; and the initiation of the contingency 
plan for Za’atri camp, which was not factored into the plan. It is expected that the total 
budget sought for Jordan will double, from the existing $85m.14 The activities of many 
local organisations, however, remain outside the RRP. 

JRC, as mentioned above, has its own beneficiary list of some 11,400 families. 
However, it is acknowledged that Syrian families receiving distributions from JRC 
overlap with some of those in the UNHCR system and also under the umbrella of 
JHCO. 

The overlap in beneficiary and registration lists is widely recognised as an issue in the 
overall response. This means that support, particularly of food/NFI distributions, and 
cash assistance, is being duplicated, and is leading to the well recognised fact that many 
refugee families are selling part of their aid on the market, especially dry food items. 
Secondary data indicates that duplication is mostly an issue in Amman and especially in 
the north of Jordan in Mafraq and Irbid, where there are a large number of local and 
international organisations working. 

12 Al Kitabwal Sunnah has reported that it and partners have 120,000 refugees registered; however, this 
cannot be verified. 
13 UN Regional Response Plan (revised), June 2012 
14 The RCRC Movement is not part of this consolidated planning process, but during September 2012 
IFRC has coordinated with the UN and other agencies, sharing details of the JRC response to date, and 
future RCRC Movement plans.

4. Assessment methodology 
4.1. Summary of Assessment Approach 
1 - Review of secondary data, including JRC and UNHCR data, and assessment reports 
from other agencies (see Annex One for the details of the assessment reports reviewed). 
An attempt was made to get a clear understanding of the response context in Jordan, 
including the issues around different registration systems and beneficiary lists. 

2 - Coordination meetings with other agencies: UNHCR, WFP, Care International, 
Danish Refugee Council, Swiss Development Corporation, JHCO, Swiss Red Cross, 
Save the Children International. Attendance at Food Sector and Cash/NFI Working 
Groups (led by WFP and UNHCR respectively). 

3 - Field assessment in six locations around Jordan, to collect primary data: 
The techniques utilised were semi-structured key informant interviews, focus group 
discussions with refugees, and home visits to refugees. A multi-sector view was taken, 
including shelter, health and education, but the focus was on understanding basic needs 
and the household economy especially food security, expenditure, income sources and 
coping strategies. Some simple participatory tools were used. The assessment also 
aimed to build up a clear profile of the refugee population and their future plans. 
Administering a questionnaire or survey tool was not considered, due to time and 
capacity constraints. 

4.2. Details of the field assessment component 
The techniques adopted are explained in detail below. 

Key informant interviews using semi-structured questions: JRC branch presidents and 
volunteers; well-informed community leaders both Syrian and Jordanian; landlords 
(where possible). 

Focus group discussions with Syrian refugees, using detailed guidance notes and 
questions: Two groups in each location, one for men and one for women. The women’s 
group was facilitated by female JRC/IFRC staff. The intention was to have around 
seven participants in each group; however the actual number was sometimes higher. A 
total of 12 focus groups were held in the six locations, with a total of 49 male and 53 
female Syrians participating. Selection of participants was done by JRC branch 
staff/volunteers, based on the existing JRC beneficiary lists. Participants were not 
selected randomly; there was an element of snowball selection as it often depended on 
who could be contacted by the JRC branch and who was available to attend the sessions. 
An element of bias was introduced due to the nature of the participants’ selection; 
however it is still felt that the groups were broadly representative of the refugee 
population. 

IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


Home visits to refugee families, two in each location – a total of twelve. These were also 
not randomly selected, but tended to be vulnerable cases which the JRC branch were 
aware of. 

4.3. Assessment team and logistical arrangements 
The assessment was lead by Richard Casagrande, British Red Cross HES Delegate. Two 
JRC volunteers were made available to work with the HES Delegate, both with 
excellent English skills. One of the volunteers was female, which was of great value for 
facilitating the women’s focus groups. The IFRC Disaster Response Delegate also 
joined for the field visits. JRC branch staff facilitated the visit in each location, and 
focus groups were usually held at the branch office (except in Karak and Naemh). The 
six days of field work were carried out between 4th and 16th September; these dates were 
chosen to allow time for other work and meetings in Amman, and also to give the team 
a chance to write up findings. The semi-structured interview questions and the guidance 
questions for focus groups were developed and discussed amongst the team in advance. 
Notes from the focus groups were recorded by two different JRC volunteers in Arabic, 
and later translated, discussed and compiled into English. 

4.4. Choice of assessment locations 
The starting point for selecting locations was the JRC registration database of Syrian 
refugees living in host communities in almost all governates of Jordan. Poverty data was 
overlaid to give an understanding of the potentially most vulnerable areas. Mafraq, 
Ma’an, and Karak governates are all ranked in the top five in Jordan for the proportion 
of the population living below the poverty line (ranging from 32% to 17%15), so were 
all priorities for inclusion. 

The locations of interventions by other organisations were considered. Many local and 
international agencies are active in the northern governates (Irbid and Mafraq), and a 
number of assessment reports exist for these areas. This fact gave support to the 
inclusion of other governates in the assessment, even though the number of refugees in 
these areas is much lower. This also recognises the unique value of JRC having 
registered Syrians in branches throughout the country, and having the potential to cover 
gaps in the overall response coverage. 

In Irbid, JRC has registered refugees in a number of villages close to Irbid city, and it 
was decided to include one of these to gain an understanding of the different context. 
Amman was included, as it has the highest number of JRC beneficiaries, and also 
because it provided a convenient starting point to test the assessment approach and 
logistics. Feedback from the JRC distribution team was that there were refugees in need 
of assistance in Ma’an, Karak and Ajloun, as well as Amman, Mafraq and Irbid. 

15 UNDP Human Development Report, 2011 

IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


Given these factors above, the following locations were selected: 

• 
Amman 
• 
Ajloun (North Jordan) 
• 
Na’emh (village in Irbid Governate, North Jordan – 20kms from Irbid city) 
• 
Ma’an (South Jordan) 
• 
Karak (Central Jordan) 
• 
Mafraq city (North Jordan) 
4.5. Limitations of Assessment Methodology 
The assessment did not use survey tools which can provide reliable quantitative data 
from a sampled population. Because of time and capacity constraints, it relied on 
interviews and focus groups to provide a detailed understanding of the situation facing 
refugees and their needs. As such, findings are mostly qualitative. Where focus groups 
have identified patterns in household expenditure and income, these cannot be 
extrapolated to the wider refugee population with statistical confidence. 

Selection of participants involved some bias on the part of JRC branch staff/volunteers, 
and also sometimes local Syrian representatives. This was unavoidable due to the 
logistical arrangements adopted for the field visits. 

It is felt that the women’s focus groups gave a more honest account of coping strategies 
and whether or not family members were working. Men seemed to have cultural 
sensitivities around discussing this issue honestly. 

Market analysis was not conducted in the field. This was due to feedback from other 
agencies and a review of assessment reports which indicated that markets were indeed 
functioning normally throughout Jordan and had responded to the additional demand 
from Syrians. There was also insufficient time to collect prices and speak to market 
actors during the field visits, and it was deemed to be of limited value to have price data 
for each location. The exception is for rent levels, which were collated through 
discussions and from local representatives. 

5. Detailed Assessment Findings 
Annex One contains some key findings from some of the assessment reports reviewed 
as secondary data. These cover mostly the North (Mafraq, Irbid), and sometimes 
Amman. In general this secondary data is in line with the results of this assessment, and 
the primary data collected in the field. 

The assessment findings in most instances did not differ materially from location to 
location. The summarised findings below only differentiate between locations where 
there is something substantively different to report. 

IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


5.1. Who are the refugees: 
• 
Majority are from Homs and Dara, from an urban or peri-urban background.16 
• 
Most have been in Jordan for several months, although there were some new 
arrivals and some have been here for more than six months 
• 
The number of children per family varies widely, with some families having a 
large number of children; the average family size is thought by assessment 
participants to be between 5 and 6. 
• 
60-80% of focus group participants were registered with UNHCR; this is a 
higher percentage than the existing JRC database indicates, highlighting that the 
assessment is not a representative sample. 
• 
Refugees acknowledged that some Syrians do not want to register with UNHCR, 
for various reasons: 
• 
Concern that their personal details will be shared with Syria, and they will 
encounter problems or be in danger when they return to Syria; or family 
members still in Syria would be at risk 
• 
Not able to travel to the UNHCR office to register (in Amman) 
• 
Do not think there is any advantage in registering 
• 
Many refugees crossing through official border points had to bribe Syrian border 
officials, ranging from $140-$28017, although many had heard of instances 
where large sums of up to $1,000 were demanded, or whatever money people 
were carrying. Crossing illegally meant you did not have to pay. 
• 
Syrians had travelled to the smaller locations (such as Ajloun, Karak, Ma’an) 
because they knew of other Syrians who had done so, or because it had been 
recommended to them to do so. Those in Amman had gone there in search of 
better economic opportunities. Those in the North were there due to the 
proximity to Syria. 
5.2. Priority Needs 
Refugees stated that cash was their biggest need, when elaborating this was broken 
down as follows: 

• 
Rent (and utilities, including water) 
• 
Fresh food (vegetables, dairy products, meat/chicken) 
• 
Other basic household expenditure items (medicines/health care, baby items, 
schooling items (including transportation to school), clothes, 
furniture/mattresses, blankets) 
Rent was clearly stated by close to 100% of informants and participants as being the 
main need. Additional needs which will arise in the coming winter months were also 
highlighted by most refugees. It was clear that there were no major needs that could not 
be met with cash, which would enable access to the market.

IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


5.3. Housing/Shelter 
• 
The vast majority of Syrian refugees outside of the camp context are living in 
rented accommodation in towns and cities, and not staying with host Jordanian 
families (except where family/friendship links exist)18. Although it is difficult to 
rely on such an estimate, assessment participants felt that more than 90% of 
Syrians were renting their own accommodation. There are examples of multiple 
Syrian families sharing a single apartment/house, but generally most families are 
living, or attempting to live, alone. 
• 
It is difficult to find accommodation to rent, and in many of the smaller locations 
only the lowest standard of accommodation is available. Many refugees reported 
cramped living conditions, and this was clearly observed in all 12 of the home 
visits. Many would prefer to move to cheaper accommodation, but cannot find 
any. In larger locations, accommodation remains available but only at the top 
end of the rental market (such as in Amman). Refugees reported that the process 
of finding suitable housing generally takes at least one month. 
• 
Rents have increased significantly across all locations in recent months, with 
Mafraq experiencing some of the largest increases. Rents are highest in Amman 
and Mafraq. Landlords and other community representatives confirmed the 
tightness in the housing rental market, suggesting that prices of the cheapest 
apartments had increased by 50-100% compared to before the crisis. Some 
refugees are renting basements, storage areas and other surplus areas within 
apartment blocks. 
Rent levels across assessment locations (average range)19 

Amman Ajloun Karak Mafraq Na'emh Ma'an 
Rent (JDs pm) 120-170 85-100 100 130-190 120-140 120-150 
Utilities (JDs per month) 30-35 20 25 25 25-35 25-30 

• 
The issue of expected higher utilities costs in the winter months was a 
commonly shared concern. There was an expectation that higher energy costs 
would increase average utility bills to 70-80 JD per month for an average family. 
• 
All refugees have access to a toilet, water and kitchen, although in the cheapest 
apartments facilities and hygiene are sometimes sub-standard, and in need of 
maintenance. Limited water supply is an issue raised by all refugees outside of 
Amman; however this is a problem faced by the wider population due to 
restricted municipal water supply (often just one day per week). As a result, 
families need water storage capacity, and must purchase drinking water. 
• 
In terms of the security of their housing situation, many refugees said their 
confidence depended on their ability to pay rent, which was limited. Owing rent 
to landlords was a common feature for refugees, sometimes up to several 
months. Having changed apartments more than once was also a common 
experience with refugees, either due to high cost, unpaid rent or having found a 
better apartment. 
18 Some reported having stayed with Jordanians for a short period when they first arrived 
19 For currency conversion: 1 JD = $1.41 USD 

IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


• 
The impact of winter was a concern for all refugees, due to the number of 
additional needs which it brings. This includes blankets, warm clothes, heaters, 
fuel/gas, and higher utility costs. The concern is greater in the northern 
governates, which experience colder conditions; although it was universally 
expressed throughout the country. 
• 
The relationship between Syrian refugees and the local Jordanian community 
was generally reported as good, by both sides. However, most refugees also 
have knowledge of cases of eviction, as well as landlords charging above market 
rents for small and inadequate apartments. There was also an impression that the 
relationship had started to change in recent months, for the worse. Women in 
particular raised some issues around the lack of dignity they felt when dealing 
with the local community, especially landlords. 
5.4. Food Security 
• 
Food security has not been assessed as an issue for refugee families. This is due 
to ongoing distributions of food parcels (including JRCs), as well as the monthly 
food voucher from WFP20. In addition to this, refugees have a number of coping 
strategies to generate small amounts of cash, which is used to purchase fresh 
food and proteins on the market. However, it should be noted that food 
distributions from many local organisations reached a peak in August, during 
Ramadan, and distributions seem to be more intermittent now. 
• 
Some families reported cutting their number of meals per day from three to two, 
but this was not perceived to be widespread. 
• 
Refugee’s perception of the quality and appropriateness of distributed food 
parcels varied, with some criticisms of the contents. In particular, Syrians do not 
feel that the inclusion of canned goods is appropriate, as they do not like to eat 
such processed items, having a strong preference for fresh vegetables and dairy 
products. There were many comments of food items being close to expiry date. 
JRCs food parcels were generally thought to be of good quality. 
• 
The re-sale of part of food parcels (and other NFIs) was commonly 
acknowledged, to generate cash for household expenditure, and enable purchase 
of fresh food. 
• 
Assessment participants estimated that around 40-50% of food needs were being 
met by aid, and the other 50-60% by purchase. However, given the monthly 
fluctuations in food distributions and household income, it was difficult to arrive 
at this estimate. 
• 
Providing for the dietary needs of infants and young children was a concern for 
some families, as this required additional cash purchases (e.g. baby food, milk 
formula). 
20 The awareness of the WFP programme was low. Since the first month of implementation was August 
2012, those refugees who are enrolled have only received one voucher to date, and do not have a clear 
understanding of their future entitlement. This is relevant only to those refugees who are registered with 
UNHCR, and who WFP has added to the scheme, although the number will continue to scale up each 
month to match UNHCR registration data. 

IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


To summarise briefly the three pillars of food security: 

• 
Access – Between food aid and small cash purchases, Syrian refugees are able to 
access enough food to meet their needs. 
• 
Availability – food is freely available in the market, and Syrians enjoy the same 
subsidies on key items as Jordanians. 
• 
Utilisation – all refugees have basic kitchen equipment (often donated by 
neighbours) and the ability to prepare food, including water. 
5.5. The Household Economy 
Attempts were made, primarily during focus groups, to build up a picture of the 
household economy, namely expenditure and income sources, as well as work and 
coping strategies. 

Monthly Household Expenditures per assessment location – in JDs per month (results 
from men’s and women’s focus groups combined)

• 
Participants were asked to consider what they thought was the normal required 
expenditure per month for an average family, not what they were actually currently 
spending. 
• 
Total monthly expenditure needs range from around 400 to 600 JD per month 
($564-$846), with costs at the higher end of this range in Amman and Mafraq, and 
lower in the other locations. 
• 
As previously noted, rental costs vary from location to location, with the highest 
costs in Mafraq and Amman. 
• 
The expenditure data for food was difficult to compile, as it depends to a large 
extent on what food aid is being received by refugees, and how much they have to 
purchase.

Household Income Sources 

The data on income sources has been compiled to allow analysis and comparison across 
locations. A number of assumptions have been made to do this, so these results should 
be considered as indicative only. A key point to note is that to find work legally in 
Jordan, Syrians must purchase a work permit ($388), which is out of the reach of most. 
Only illegal work, at low pay, is possible, and in most of the assessment locations there 
are few opportunities.

• 
Refugees indicated a limited range of income sources, with work/wages 
consistently ranked lower than aid/charity. 
• 
Aid/charity, which as a category could consist of re-sold aid, cash aid, or gifts from 
individuals or the local community, was reported as the main income source in all 
locations. 
• 
Cash generated by re-selling aid, a component of overall aid/charity, was itself an 
important income source in most locations, ranging in importance from 5%-30% of 
the total. 
• 
Income from work was a more important source in Amman than other locations. 
• 
Some small business income was also reported in Amman. 
• 
The sale of assets and reliance on savings was also reported as a minor income 
source in most locations. 
• 
Remittances from Syria are not an income source for refugees in Jordan. 
Work and Income Generation 

• 
The majority of Syrian refugees were described as coming from a ‘low to 
middle’ socio-economic background. Most men worked in Syrian as skilled or 
21 Data is missing for Ajloun, due to some limitations with the focus group process there. 

IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


unskilled workers, small business owners, taxi drivers and so on. Only a small 
percentage of women worked in Syria (estimated at 20%). 

• 
Across all locations, it is clear that informal work opportunities for adults are 
very limited, with the exception of Amman. Wage rates are below the market 
and minimum levels for Jordanians. 
• 
The absence of work opportunities is particularly true in smaller governates, or 
locations which are outside of main urban centres (Karak, Naemh in Irbid, 
Ma’an). 
• 
In every location, some refugee children are engaged in work, at very low pay, 
because this seems to be the most commonly available opportunity for a family 
member to work. Children as young as eleven are working, usually in 
restaurants/cafes, shops and the like. 
• 
Working conditions for both men and children were reported as difficult – long 
hours, usually 10-12 per day, low pay, and the risk of being exploited and not 
paid at all. 
• 
Women were not comfortable to discuss openly whether they were working or 
not; however, there were indications that some of them are engaged in domestic 
work for Jordanian families, but felt this was undignified. 
• 
Average wage rates for men were considered to be between 8-10 JD per day, 
possibly more if skilled labour. 
• 
Average wage rates for children were reported at between 2-5 JD per day. 
• 
In Mafraq, there was a sense that refugees were not seeking work opportunities 
and were content to depend on aid. 
Savings and Debt 

• 
Assessment participants acknowledged that many Syrians had left Syria with 
some resources – savings or transportable assets such as jewelry. However, it is 
clear that these resources have been rapidly depleted in Jordan in the first 
months here, as a coping mechanism for meeting basic expenditures. 
• 
Those who had fled the sudden spike in violence in Syria in recent months had 
very limited ability to bring any resources with them, and as a result most new 
arrivals do not have savings to rely on. 
• 
Many Syrians are in debt to their landlords for rent, some up to three months, 
and their ability to pay rent in the future is limited. As such, the threat of 
eviction exists – although it must be recognised that there are numerous 
examples where local landlords are extending credit on an informal basis to 
Syrians, giving them time to generate some cash and pay off rent owing. Small 
debts to shop owners for fresh food were also reported by some refugees; also 
debt to other Syrian refugees. 
• 
There was a strong sense from assessment participants that wealthier Syrians 
had left the country earlier, taking their assets and resources with them, and were 
residing in Amman or Beirut, Lebanon. As they are not in need they do not 
approach organizations for support, and are effectively ‘outside’ of the aid 
system. 
IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


5.6. Health Care 
• 
Syrian refugees who are registered with UNHCR can access the public health 
system (clinics and hospitals). However, medicines need to be purchased, and 
treatment for ongoing chronic conditions or any medical issue that requires 
specialist care or hospitalisation does not appear to be accessible (as reported by 
refugees with first hand experience of this). 
• 
Some refugees not registered with UNHCR reported that they had been able to 
visit local health clinics, with the requirement to show the UNHCR registration 
being informally waived. However, this varied from location to location, and 
was not universally agreed, so appears to be on a case-by-case basis and at the 
discretion of the local health care provider. 
• 
Cases were reported, and observed, of men who had been injured or tortured in 
the conflict in Syria, and required ongoing medical care that they could not 
afford. 
• 
Many refugees have a family member with a chronic condition, especially 
diabetes and hypertension, and were encountering difficulties in purchasing 
medicines. Some have a family member with a terminal illness, and are turning 
to private medical care at a high cost. Similar issues were reported for refugees 
with disabilities. Where there was a problem in obtaining medicines, refugees 
indicated that the issue was insufficient cash to fund the purchase, not a lack of 
availability in pharmacies. 
5.7. Education 
• 
School-aged children of Syrian refugees who are registered with UNHCR can 
enroll in public schools. The requirement to produce documentation (such as 
birth certificates) for children was reported to be causing some confusion and 
delays in enrolment.22 
• 
Many schools are crowded, and a double shift system is in operation to deal with 
the high numbers of children. 
• 
Although no fees are charged to attend school,23 some refugees reported that 
they had difficulty in funding other costs related to children’s education – 
uniforms, shoes, books, materials and so on. Transportation costs to and from 
school were also a factor, especially for those who are outside of core urban 
areas. 
• 
Refugees were aware that if they were not registered with UNHCR, it meant 
their children would have to pay fees to attend school; however they are not 
clear what fees may be charged if children can successfully enroll. Private 
schools are also available, but only if the high fees can be paid. Since the school 
year has just started (in September), many refugees do not yet understand the 
school situation 
22 It is understood from coordination meetings that this requirement is now being waived by the Ministry 
of Education, after lobbying by UNICEF/Save the Children 
23 GoJ statement: Syrians residing in cities who are not registered with UNHCR can enrol in private 
schools or public schools, but will have to pay fees. Syrians who are registered with UNHCR can join 
public schools and will be given one month to submit the required papers. As reported in The Jordan 
Times, 11th September 2012, Page 2

• 
As previously mentioned, some children in vulnerable families are working, and 
this has been prioritised over education. 
• 
In general, it was clear from assessment participants that expenditure on 
education was not one of the top priorities for the more vulnerable families. 
5.8. Markets 
• 
As explained in the section on assessment limitations, market analysis was not 
conducted in the field. It is clear from the review of secondary data and 
coordination discussions that markets in Jordan are not disrupted in any way and 
are functioning normally. They have been able to respond to the additional 
demand from Syrian refugees. The exception to this is the housing rental market, 
which is heavily impacted as was explained above. 
• 
Assessment participants were asked about inflation, especially food price 
inflation. Most reported that there had not been any noticeable changes in prices 
since they arrived in Jordan – although refugees were quick to highlight the 
significantly higher cost of living in Jordan as compared to Syria. 
• 
The exception to this was in Mafraq and Amman, where it seems the price of 
fresh food has increased in recent months. 
• 
In the governates with a lower number of refugees, their smaller number is 
unlikely to impact on the market and prices. Also, it is difficult to disaggregate 
any impact caused by the additional demand from Syrian refugees, from general 
price rises caused by global food and fuel price inflation. 
5.9. Support received to date by refugees 
The table below sets out the assistance received to date by assessment participants. It 
should not be interpreted as definitive for the wider refugee population.

Some awareness of 
UNHCR cash assistance, 
but none receiving yet 

• 
There is low awareness around the country of the UNHCR cash assistance 
programme and the WFP food voucher programme. There were some mentions 
of the first food voucher received in August by a small number of assessment 
participants, but most were not aware it is going to be ongoing. This also 
highlights the gap which exists for those refugees who are not UNHCR 
registered. 
• 
JRC distributions are irregular and infrequent in some locations. 
• 
The support from local organisations appears to have decreased significantly 
since Ramadan. 
• 
Mafraq is the only location where there a clear indication was given by 
assessment participants that support is continuous. 
5.10. Assessment Findings Specific to a Cash Intervention 
The IFRC preliminary emergency appeal suggested that a cash response was 
appropriate. With this in mind, the assessment gathered information relevant to a 
potential cash programme: 

• 
Refugees were overwhelming in favour of being given cash assistance, rather 
than in-kind distributions. This was reinforced in discussions which highlighted 
the sale of aid items (at prices well below their value), which is done to generate 
cash to meet basic needs. It was felt by some refugees that dry food distributions 
are also appropriate, but they need to be supplemented with cash to meet rent 
and other needs. Most refugees felt that cash would allow them to prioritise their 
own needs. 
• 
Some refugees, especially women, reported that aid distributions caused them a 
loss of dignity, and because of their high visibility could also generate jealousy 
amongst local Jordanians. They felt that cash was more discrete way of 
providing assistance. 
• 
When posed the question ‘what is the first thing you would do if you were given 
cash today’, most assessment participants answered that they would pay rent. 
IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


This was followed by paying off debts, buying food (meat and vegetables), 
clothes, baby items, medicine and so on. 

• 
Security – all Syrian and Jordanian participants in the assessment felt that aid 
distributions in Jordan were secure, and additionally felt that being given cash 
would not raise any security issues. 
• 
All Syrian refugees have access to a mobile phone – this was also observed 
during home visits24. 
• 
Refugees are familiar with money transfer or remittance companies, and some of 
them have used them before in Syria. 
• 
A small proportion of refugees have no ID or documentation with them in 
Jordan; most have passports and/or UNHCR registration. 
• 
Men and women differ in their opinion of who handles money within the family 
– women felt that it was mostly them; men varied in their opinion and no clear 
trend was discernible. No gender issues were detected through the assessment 
that would affect the provision and usage of cash within families. 
6. Analysis 
of Refugees’ Coping Strategies, Future Plans, 
Vulnerability and Gaps 
While a food security problem is not present, it is clear that many refugees living in the 
community have difficulty in meeting basic household expenditures, and are uncertain 
about how they will provide for all their needs in the coming months. Rent is the 
priority need, along with fresh food, medicines, and items for children and babies. The 
impact of winter will also bring further necessary expenditure - blankets, warm clothes, 
heaters/fuel, higher electricity bills and so on. It also seems apparent that the one-off 
support from local organisations reached its peak during Ramadan, and is now tailing 
off. 
The assessment findings are broadly in line with the secondary data reviewed, and also 
substantiate that refugees throughout the country, in governates like Karak, Ma’an and 
Ajloun, face similar difficulties as in Amman, Mafraq and Irbid. 

6.1. Coping Strategies 
The main coping strategies which refugees are adopting to meet their basic needs and 
expenditures are as follows: 

• 
Dependency on aid, especially food distributions 
• 
Re-selling unwanted aid items on the market to generate cash 
• 
Incurring debt, especially to landlords for unpaid rent 
• 
Children engaging in informal work – generally adolescents, but reported as 
young as eleven (and thus not attending school) 
24 Initially some families registered with JRC with just one phone number between several families; 
however, it is thought now that mobile phone ownership is close to 100%. 

IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


• 
Women working informally, in domestic work (not widespread) 
• 
Men changing occupation and looking for any informal work available – but 
there are very limited opportunities outside of Amman 
• 
Begging – only hinted at in women’s focus groups, but personal dignity 
prevented this being discussed 
• 
Reduction in meals from three per day to two – but not widespread 
Refugees are engaging in these coping strategies, but it is clear from the analysis of 
monthly expenditure needs and income sources that there is an income gap in many 
households. Many families are relying on a combination of aid, gifts, and cash 
generated by re-selling aid as their main income source. Whilst managing to achieve 
basic food security, the more vulnerable refugees cannot fund their other household 
costs; where they currently can, it is likely that many of these families will encounter 
difficulties in the coming months. 

Rent is a special issue – in order to maintain access to housing, refugees need assistance 
to pay rent, and also to pay down debts to landlords, to remove the threat of eviction. 
With a tight housing market and limited options to move to more affordable 
accommodation, the most pressing expenditure gap to fill is cash to pay rent. 

6.2. Future Plans for Refugees 
• 
Most refugees do not expect the situation to change in Syria soon, at least not 
within six months. Some think it could be as long as one to two years before 
return is possible. 
• 
Almost all refugees share the view that they will not return to Syria until there is 
a change of regime. 
• 
Most refugees expect to be reliant on aid and assistance during their stay in 
Jordan, as they cannot foresee finding work which can provide sufficient income 
to meet basic expenditure needs. The willingness to work was expressed by most 
men, but options are perceived as very limited. 
• 
The cost of living is seen as very high in Jordan. This combined with the 
inability to find work may cause some refugees to return to Syria if there is some 
improvement in security. However, this was not a widely held view, and 
appeared to be mostly due to not being able to survive in Jordan. 
6.3. Vulnerability within the Refugee Population 
In terms of vulnerability, a number of key groups within the wider refugee population 
are assessed as being most in need. In many instances, the reasons for their vulnerability 
are quite obvious, and can be summarised as having specific expenditure needs which 
cannot be met through current household income sources. The table below provides 
more details. 

IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


Summary of key vulnerable groups in assessed refugee population 

Vulnerable Groups Details of vulnerability 
Women-headed households 
-UNHCR data shows that 30% of refugee 
households are women-headed 
Lower capacity to find work and generate 
income, as no adult male in the household 
Large households (with many children) 
-UNHCR data shows that 35% of refugee 
households have 6 or more members 
Additional costs for clothes/NFIs, 
commodities for winter, fresh food, 
school materials and uniforms 
Households with children under five Specific expenditure needs for diapers, 
baby food/milk, other baby items 
Households with a family member who 
has a chronic health condition 
Inability to cover costs of medicines and 
ongoing medical care 
Households with a family member who 
was injured in the conflict in Syria and 
requires ongoing medical care 
Inability to cover cost of ongoing medical 
care 
Households with a disabled family 
member 
Inability to cover costs of specific care 
Multiple families who are sharing the 
same accommodation (in cramped 
conditions) 
Inability to cover cost of renting further 
accommodation 

Note that many of these vulnerabilities overlap, and can be present within the same 
family, thus compounding the gap between necessary expenditure on basic items and 
the available household income sources. 
Not being registered with UNHCR is also something of a proxy indicator for 
vulnerability, which will be discussed in detail later in this report. 

Difficulties with income and a poverty line as a vulnerability indicator 
When considering income and poverty indicators, it is difficult to assess refugees based 
on income levels or whether someone in the family is working. Firstly, answers from 
refugees about work and income are not very reliable, with a strong incentive present to 
under-report income. Additionally, the assessment has shown that there are very limited 
work opportunities for refugees, and where they exist they are informal, poorly paid, 
and sporadic/infrequent. Indeed, estimating monthly income is not easy for most 
households, due to the fluctuating and uncertain nature of most income sources. Having 
a family member engaged in some kind of work does not indicate that the family is not 
vulnerable. 
The best way to identify the most vulnerable is to prioritise the groups mentioned 
above, and follow up with a short household verification visit. Observation of the 
housing situation and living conditions is the best way to confirm who the most 
vulnerable are – not attempts to rank income or wealth. 

6.4. Timing of Needs 
There are two main findings from the assessment which help to understand questions of 
timing: 

IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


• 
The length of time in Jordan is not itself an indicator of vulnerability. New 
arrivals may have specific and urgent needs, and may also be in need of longer 
term support. However, families who have been in Jordan for some months may 
also be part of the most vulnerable, having exhausted resources they were able to 
bring with them, or running out of coping strategies to adopt (for example, no 
further assets to sell, can’t rely on diminishing aid distributions). 
• 
The needs identified through the assessment are very likely to continue for the 
foreseeable future. Whilst more timely assistance is always desirable, in this 
context support which is provided to refugees living in communities in the 
coming months will still have a positive impact. It is difficult to assign a number 
to this, but for the next 4-6 months the situation is likely to be maintained, or 
indeed be exacerbated by the arrival of further refugees. 
6.5. Geographical Targeting 
The choice of locations for a future intervention for refugees living in the community 
should be guided by the following: 

• 
JRC’s ability to reach governates throughout the country, with its network of 
branches, and existing beneficiary list of refugees in eight governates. A 
significant proportion of these refugees are not registered with UNHCR, which 
is an important factor that can indicate vulnerability. 
• 
The assessment findings for Mafraq, which show refugees there are receiving 
ongoing support from a number of sources. 
• 
The lack of other agencies providing assistance in many of the other governates 
(such as Karak, Ma’an, Ajloun). 
• 
Location and design of other planned agency programmes in cash/NFIs; close 
coordination will be required to ensure that future assistance does not overlap. 
7. Mapping the Wider Humanitarian Response in Food, NFIs and 
Cash 
Before moving on to analysing different response options to meet the needs identified 
through the assessment, it is necessary to give consideration to three other key parts of 
the wider humanitarian response in Jordan, before making any recommendations: JRCs 
existing distributions, other agency responses, and the UNHCR registration process. 

7.1. Understanding JRC relief distributions and the registration process 
It is important to have a good understanding of this, because it will be the starting point 
for any new RCRC intervention to support household expenditures for refugees. JRC 
have registered Syrian refugees living in the community throughout the country, using 
its network of branches, since the start of 2012. To register, Syrians must: 

IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


• 
Produce personal documentation – either a passport, UNHCR registration, or the 
‘bail out’ guarantee letter which allowed them to leave a transit camp and reside 
in the community.25 Photocopies are taken. UNHCR registration is requested if 
refugees have it. 
• 
Prove date of entry – this must be after January 2012, to evidence that they are 
indeed refugees of the current crisis, and not previous economic migrants. 
Only basic data has been collected from the refugees, and this has not been done in full 
in all locations. The data collected covers: 

• 
Name of head of family 
• 
Documentation details (number, type) 
• 
Date of entry to Jordan 
• 
Number of people in family 
• 
Number of men, women, children under 5 (data is incomplete, only for part of 
Amman) 
• 
Name of spouse (if in Jordan) 
• 
Spouse documentation details (number, type) 
• 
Phone number 
• 
Location (area, not address) 
Single person households have not been registered. 
Relief distributions to date have covered some 11,000 households on this beneficiary 
list26. Distributions are not targeted according to vulnerability, but instead cover all 
refugees registered. They occur on a roughly monthly basis, with priority for each 
distribution being given to newly registered families, then families who have waited for 
the longest period without receiving support. The intention is to continue these 
distributions, particularly food, until at least the end of 2012.27 

It is acknowledged within JRC that there is some overlap between these distributions 
and other agencies work, including UNHCR/WFP, and the local organisations under the 
JHCO umbrella. It is also clear that some of the food items are re-sold by refugees. A 
further issue which staff are aware of is the ‘loophole’ whereby different adult family 
members can potentially register separately, thus giving them the chance to secure 
multiple distributions items for the same family. 

Due to the lack of data collected during the registration process which can provide 
insight into vulnerability or living arrangements, it is not possible to start to target 
refugees for any further additional assistance using the JRC beneficiary list. It is 
important to start to collect more data on beneficiaries during on-going relief 
distributions, in order to build up a clear picture of vulnerability and allow targeting in 
the near future. In addition, the ongoing process of registering new refugees should use 

25 This bail-out process no longer exists, since the advent of Za’atri camp. 
26 Distributions to date have included: 

• 
53,000 food parcels 
• 
11,000 hygiene kits 
• 
500 kerosene heaters 
• 
4,000 blankets 
This has been with support from throughout the RCRC Movement and other partners, but especially from 
the Emirati, Qatari and Saudi Red Crescent Societies. 
27 This would be with Emirati RC support, but at this stage no firm distribution plan exists. 

IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


a new form which captures this vulnerability data, and individuals should also be 
considered for registration. 

There are also some issues with the existing ‘database’, which is MS Excel-based, in 
terms of data quality and duplication. Work to improve this, and possibly move to a 
more robust solution (such as an MS Access database), should be considered as part of 
any future programming. JRC should consider the scenario that long-term programming 
may be required with Syrian refugees – in which case the need to establish a good 
dataset now is even more important. 

7.2. Mapping other Agency Programmes 
As discussed in Section Three, there are many agencies active in Jordan, and there is 
common acknowledgement that assistance for Syrian refugees has been duplicated in 
the past, and coordination is not effective. As such, an important part of this assessment 
is to understand what other agencies are doing, or planning to do. A mapping matrix of 
relevant agency programmes and plans in cash and related food/NFI and voucher 
interventions has been constructed through a review of secondary data and bilateral 
coordination meetings with other agencies, as well as through attendance at UN-led 
sectoral working groups.28 This is contained in Annex Three. 

It is worth highlighting the main areas of potential overlap, and considering whether 
they are complimentary to, or in duplication with, any future RCRC programme that 
addresses the household expenditure needs of Syrian refugees. 

• 
WFP food voucher programme – blanket coverage for all UNHCR-registered 
refugee families with monthly food vouchers. Throughout the country. 
o 
Any RCRC programme to support non-food household needs would 
compliment this, not overlap 
• 
UNHCR cash assistance programme – 6,000 of the most vulnerable UNHCR-
registered refugee families receive monthly cash assistance, for rent (1,800 
enrolled as at end September 2012). Throughout the country. 
o 
Any RCRC programme to support non-food household needs would 
potentially overlap with this, and would require close coordination and 
sharing of beneficiary details. 
• 
Care International urgent cash assistance – 1,000 vulnerable refugee families in 
Amman receive one-off urgent cash (cases referred from UNHCR) 
o 
As Care’s assistance is one-off, for urgent needs, it is not likely to 
overlap with a RCRC programme supporting non-food household needs, 
but only if on-going assistance is provided for the most vulnerable. 
• 
Danish Refugee Council NFI voucher – 600 vulnerable refugee families in 
Ma’an and Karak receive a one-time voucher, for winter/NFI/medicine needs 
o 
As DRC’s assistance is one-off and for specific commodity and winter 
needs, it is not likely to overlap with a RCRC programme supporting 
28 This 3W matrix was not available from any source, hence one had to be compiled as part of the 
assessment. 

IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


non-food household needs such as rent, provided only the most 
vulnerable are targeted. 

• 
JHCO and Al Kitabwal Sunnah – Cash assistance and NFI distributions 
o 
Little is known of how Al Kitabwal Sunnah targets its assistance, or 
exactly what it provides; so it is difficult to assess the extent of potential 
overlaps. 
• 
Save the Children International (planned) – 3,000 vulnerable refugees in cash 
transfer programme in Amman and Zarqa, including UNHCR registered and 
non-registered refugees; as well as 20% poor Jordanian households in areas of 
implementation 
o 
Any RCRC programme to support non-food household needs would 
overlap with this, so would require close coordination and sharing of 
beneficiary details. 
• 
International Rescue Committee (planned) – cash assistance programme in 
Mafraq and Irbid – details unknown at this stage. 
o 
Any RCRC programme to support non-food household needs would 
potentially overlap with this, so would require close coordination and 
sharing of beneficiary details. 
7.3. Understanding the UNHCR registration process, gaps and time lags 
As the assessment has shown, UNHCR registration is a key factor in understanding the 
refugee context in Jordan. The registration process is time consuming and is centralised, 
with registration taking place only in the main UNHCR office in Amman, and in 
Ramtha (Mafraq). There is a waiting list of refugees who are awaiting registration 
appointments; additionally, the residents of Za’atri camp have not yet been registered. 
Whilst UNHCR has arranged transportation for refugees to travel from other locations 
in Jordan to its Amman office, it is not clear how frequently this happens, and many 
refugees reported during the assessment that they cannot afford the transportation costs 
to travel to Amman to register. There has been discussion of UNHCR opening further 
registration centres, but as of September 2012 this has not been approved by the GoJ 
and was not moving forward. 

There is a time lag in the registration process, with over 3,000 families waiting for their 
appointments (as at 16th September 2012). Once refugees are registered, they become 
eligible for the WFP food voucher programme, but with a further one month lag before 
they can be added to the monthly food voucher cycle – as an example, the first WFP 
voucher cycle in August 2012 covered only around 20,000 refugees. The most 
vulnerable families are also assessed for inclusion in the UNHCR cash assistance 
programme, but this also entails a lag of up to two months before eligible families start 
to receive cash - due to the time-consuming process of home visits, and the subsequent 
registration process with the bank which is required. 

IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


The implication of these procedures is that it can take up to 3 months, sometimes 
longer, for refugees to register and start to receive assistance from WFP and UNHCR29. 

In many ways, the status of not being registered with UNHCR is effectively a kind of 
proxy indicator for vulnerability. For refugees not registered, the implications are: 

• 
No access to the public health system30 
• 
Children cannot attend public schools for free 
• 
Not included in the WFP food voucher programme 
• 
Not eligible for UNHCR’s cash assistance (for the most vulnerable families). 
The fact that JRC has a beneficiary list with a large number of refugees who are not 
registered with UNHCR is significant31, particularly given the privacy and security 
concerns outlined in the assessment findings for why refugees choose not to register 
with the UN. For reasons of policy, it is not recommended to actually select 
beneficiaries based on not being UNHCR-registered, as the GoJ continues to encourage 
refugees to register. Additionally, the number of registrations by UNHCR will continue 
to increase on a monthly basis. 

However, it is likely that a proportion of Syrians will continue to prefer to remain 
unregistered, so this factor remains an important consideration for JRC in selecting the 
locations and targeting any future intervention. JRC has access to this more vulnerable 
case-load of refugees, and is well placed to fill the gap in assistance. 

RECOMMENDATION: For any future JRC intervention, the UN-registration status of 
refugees indicates a degree of extra vulnerability, and it should be carefully considered 
how this could impact on beneficiary selection. 

8. Appropriateness of Cash Programming 
Before examining response options, of which cash programming is an obvious one, it is 
important to establish whether the pre-conditions for cash are present in Jordan, in this 
particular context. 

• 
Conversations with other agencies did not highlight any barriers to a cash 
intervention in Jordan. The national policy framework is supportive of cash 
transfers, in fact the GoJ recently announced that it will introduce cash transfers 
29 There is some other assistance provided to newly arrived refugees by UNCHR, but focus here is on the 
WFP food vouchers and the UNHCR cash assistance. 
30 Although note that there is some anecdotal evidence of UNHCR-registration being overlooked at 
public health clinics31 As a reminder, 30%-59% of the current JRC database are not registered with UNHCR, depending on 
the governate (consider as indicative only, because people’s registration status is subject to change). 

IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


to deliver subsidies to targeted impoverished segments of the population in next 
year’s budget32. 

• 
Cash transfers are well acknowledged as a response to refugee needs, having 
been used in Jordan in the last decade to support Iraqi refugees. 
• 
Cash transfers are already being implemented for Syrian refugees, most notably 
by UNHCR and Care International (as well as one-off assistance provided by 
local organizations). 
• 
Markets are functioning normally throughout the country, and the number of 
Syrians who are likely to be supported with cash assistance in each governate is 
not large enough relevant to the wider population to generate a determinable 
impact on inflation. There are two exceptions to this: the first is the housing 
market, which is experiencing rent inflation; however, this is occurring anyway 
due to the influx of refugees and demand for housing, and the provision of cash 
to support rent payments is itself not expected have a further material effect – 
since any assistance would largely be for families who already have rented 
accommodation. The second exception is in Mafraq, where the higher proportion 
of refugees seems to have caused a small amount of food price inflation so far. 
• 
Refugees are overwhelming living in an urban context, with easy access to 
markets. 
• 
JRC has experience in making direct cash transfers, through an ongoing 
programme to support orphans which is supported by the Emirates Red 
Crescent. 2,400 orphans receive cash transfer every three months, which is 
distributed as actual cash direct to beneficiaries. 
• 
Assessment findings clearly showed that refugees have a preference for cash, for 
its ability to cover the wide range of expenditure needs they have, as well as 
providing them with the dignity of choice, and avoiding the embarrassment of 
in-kind distributions. 
• 
The widespread re-selling of aid items that has taken place throughout Jordan, to 
generate cash, also provides strong support for direct cash provision. 
• 
No security or gender issues have been highlighted around the distribution and 
use of cash. 
• 
Corruption risks, or potential diversion of cash transfers, are also assessed as 
low. There are no local elites or ‘gate-keepers’ linked to Syrian refugees who 
could potentially engage in these practices. The risk of corruption in beneficiary 
selection will always exist, and must be mitigated with careful and transparent 
selection criteria and subsequent verification process. 
• 
All needs identified through the assessment could be provided for by the market, 
providing refugees have cash to access the market. 
• 
Cash payment mechanisms exist in Jordan, including (at least) the following 
options: 
o 
Payment through banking system – as adopted by UNHCR 
o 
Payment through money transfer (or remittance) companies – as adopted 
by at least one INGO 
o 
Payment by cheque, to be cashed at bank with ID 
o 
Direct cash distribution 
32 This will replace blanket subsidies on goods, which are a ‘disaster’ according to the Minister of 
Industry and Trade, who said it is better to deliver support directly to those who need it. Source: The 
Jordan Times, 3rd September 2012, Page 1 

IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


• 
In support of these payment mechanisms, refugees have indicated that: 
o 
They can access a mobile phone 
o 
They have familiarity with money transfer companies 
o 
Only a small proportion are missing personal documentation (a reliable 
ID card would need to be created for those with no documentation for the 
purposes of cash programming). 
It is clear from the above points that cash is an appropriate intervention for 
consideration in Jordan. 

9. Objective and Response Option Analysis 
9.1. Objective 
The most appropriate objective for an intervention to meet the needs identified in the 
assessment, for the most vulnerable refugees living in the community, is: 

Ensure the most vulnerable refugee households can meet their basic non-food 
household expenditure needs and have access to NFIs protecting them from winter 

Assistance should be targeted to the most vulnerable households; this would 
compliment the ongoing (more blanket) relief distributions of JRC while ensuring that 
the impact of the resources available on those who need support the most is maximised. 
The analysis in the sections above has identified a starting point for developing 
vulnerability selection criteria, as well as geographical targeting. The need to consider 
the factor of UNHCR registration is also crucial, because this also reflects a degree of 
vulnerability. 

In order to enable vulnerability targeting to be done, it is recommended that JRC starts a 
new data collection process, for its existing caseload of Syrian refugees. This can be 
done through their ongoing distributions of relief items. It will be necessary to have data 
which indicates vulnerability, as well as a clear indication of the UNHCR registration 
status. This is also an opportunity to train JRC staff and volunteers in data and 
beneficiary management. 

It is true that a process of further data collection, to enable targeting of assistance, will 
take time and delay the start of further programming. But as the assessment clearly 
demonstrated, the needs of the most vulnerable refugee families are not likely to change 
or improve in the near future, meaning that assistance will still be timely if the time is 
taken to target. To put it another way, a quick response is preferable, but not essential. 

RECOMMENDATION: Improve data management process within JRC – clean 
existing database, change registration form, collect more data through ongoing JRC 
relief distributions, and consider migrating the database from Excel to Access

region feasible (targeting not an

An unconditional cash transfer for non-food household needs is recommended as the 
optimal intervention, as it: 

• 
Will allow beneficiaries to prioritise their household expenditure needs, which 
are varied 
• 
Provides maximum dignity and choice 
• 
Does not tie the assistance to any particular item (e.g. rent, NFIs) 
• 
Does not have large-scale logistical needs 
• 
Supports local markets and can be expected to have a multiplier effect on the 
local economy 
The transfer should be targeted to the most vulnerable households. 

9.3. What Kind of Cash Transfer? 
Ongoing, not one-off assistance, should be provided, as it is unlikely that a one-off 
intervention is going to materially impact the situation of the most vulnerable. 
Expressed another way, while one-off support to a larger beneficiary group will provide 
some relief and cover some household expenditure gaps in the month of provision, the 
most vulnerable will still be facing the same issues in the next month. The opportunity 
to make a bigger impact on the needs of the most vulnerable will have been lost by 
extending support to a wider group through a one-off intervention.33 

An appropriate period of ongoing support would be from three to six months, based on 
the timing issues identified in the assessment, which clearly showed that the needs of 
the vulnerable refugee families are not likely to change significantly in the coming 
months. 

The appropriate amount for the cash transfer can be set with reference to the monthly 
household expenditure data gathered in the assessment; also in coordination with other 
agencies. It should cover average monthly rent, plus a small additional amount for other 
priority expenditure. To the extent that rent is the key expenditure gap, rent levels need 
to be closely monitored to ensure that the transfer amount remains appropriate. 

Geographical targeting and coordination with other agencies will lead to the selection of 
certain governates for a cash programme, in locations where JRC has an operational 
presence and there is a gap in coverage from other agencies. In this case, an intervention 
which includes both cash assistance and distribution of winter items could also meet the 
objective effectively, providing they are in different areas: 

• 
Ongoing unconditional cash transfers to cover non-food household expenditure 
needs, targeted at most vulnerable refugee households, in selected governates. 
33 This assumes that within a fixed budget, a one-off intervention could target a larger group; while ongoing 
support would necessitate targeting a smaller group of the most vulnerable. 

IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


• 
A one-off, in-kind distribution of winter NFIs (blankets, mattresses, heaters etc) 
in the northern governates, alongside existing JRC distributions (blanket 
coverage of JRC beneficiary list). 
The additional beneficiary data requirements for a cash programme means it will take 
longer to establish, which leaves open the option of in-kind distributions for winter 
which could be done more rapidly. 

RECOMMENDATION: Implement a targeted unconditional cash transfer for 
vulnerable households; a monthly transfer for at least three months, calculated at 
average rent plus an additional amount for other priority household expenditures. 
This could be supplemented with in-kind distributions of NFIs for winter, in areas 
where the cash transfer is not implemented. 

9.4. Coordination and sharing of beneficiary lists 
As mentioned several times, coordination with other implementing agencies will be 
crucial for a cash intervention, especially to guide the choice of locations. Within 
locations, it will be necessary to arrange the sharing of beneficiary lists to ensure that 
assistance is not duplicated34. UNHCR’s RAIS system can enable cross-checking of 
names, and JRC should request access to the system. This will allow any UNHCR cash 
assistance beneficiaries to be excluded from the RCRC cash programme. 

However, this does not address the issue of refugees who have not registered with 
UNHCR. An important decision for JRC is whether it should share details of its 
beneficiaries who have indicated they are not registered with UNHCR. This is a policy 
decision – some of these Syrians have approached JRC because they are not 
comfortable to register with the UN; sharing their details may not be appropriate from a 
protection perspective. 

If this is decided as the policy position of JRC and RCRC, there would effectively be a 
one-way flow of data from UNHCR to JRC, to ensure there is no duplication of cash 
assistance, but no corresponding flow of data from JRC to UNHCR, due to the privacy 
concerns of the non-registered refugees. 

RECOMMENDATION: Coordinate closely with other agencies on selection of 
locations. Agree policy on sharing data, and how this can be done without protection 
issues. Use UNHCR RAIS system to cross-check JRC cash assistance beneficiaries and 
remove duplicates. 

34 Indications are that Save the Children International and International Rescue Committee will be key 
agencies to collaborate with, as well as UNHCR. 

IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


9.5. JRC Capacity 
JRC has a network of branches and volunteers who have already been active in the 
registration of Syrian refugees and distribution of relief items. This programme presents 
an opportunity for RCRC to support JRC and help build capacity in a number of key 
programming areas: 

• 
Registration and data management 
• 
Beneficiary communications and accountability 
• 
Beneficiary management and monitoring 
• 
Cash transfer mechanisms 
In particular it is a chance to build capacity at branch level and with volunteers. 
Training for staff and volunteers will be required35, both in disaster management basics, 
but also in the field procedures related to cash programming. An operation under the 
IFRC Emergency Appeal will need to scale up local staff resources within JRC at the 
Amman headquarters, as well as conduct this essential capacity building with branches 
and volunteers. 
RECOMMENDATION: Use the cash programme as an opportunity for capacity 
building for JRC staff and volunteers, especially in disaster management principles and 
field work basics. 

10.Other Considerations for Implementation 

10.1. Cross-cutting issues 
Age 
The percentage of refugees over 60 years of age is very low – less than 2% according to 
the current UNHCR registration data. For this reason the elderly have not been 
highlighted as a separate vulnerable group through this assessment. 

Gender 
The assessment has not revealed any particular gender-based issues that are directly 
related to cash programming. That is, gender and power relationships within households 
are not expected to impact the ability of cash transfers to achieve the identified 
objective. Of course there are numerous issues facing women and girls as a result of this 
refugee crisis. Survivors of gender-based violence, women in need of psychosocial care, 
widows and so on have been highlighted by a number of agencies who specialise in 

35 Disaster Management training is being considered for late October for volunteers; this can be extended 
to include aspects of cash programming. 

IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


these sectors 36 . However, because this assessment has focused on the household 
economy and the gaps of basic expenditure over income sources, these concerns are out 
of scope. 

10.2. 
‘Do no harm’ – the impact of assistance for Syrian refugees on 
Jordanians 
There is a risk that the implementation of additional programming for Syrian refugees 
could increase resentment amongst the local Jordanian community, and lead to a rise in 
tension between them and their guests. 
Already, poorer Jordanians are facing the following issues: 


• 
Pre-existing poverty and high unemployment 
• 
Rising cost of living 
• 
Rising rents, especially in the North and Amman, caused by the refugee influx 
• 
Potential for food price inflation in the North, also caused by the refugee influx 
The perception amongst more vulnerable members of the local Jordanian community 
will be that Syrian refugees are being supported to an unfair degree, whilst their needs 
are overlooked. Future programming needs to take this into account, to ensure 
acceptance and success. 

One option is to consider the inclusion of vulnerable Jordanians in a cash assistance 
programme. This assessment has not had the time to investigate this option fully, but 
several other agencies indicated that they were considering including poor Jordanian 
beneficiaries in their cash programmes, up to 20% of the total caseload37. There were 
also reports that the GoJ had requested agencies to consider this option.38 JRC does not 
have a readily available beneficiary identification mechanism for vulnerable Jordanians; 
however, potential ways of doing this should be explored. 

RECOMMENDATION: Monitor changes in sentiment from the local community, and 
consider including vulnerable Jordanians in future programming, alongside Syrian 
refugees. For any extension of a cash programme, or longer-term work, this is a must. 

10.3. Medium to Longer-Term Programming for Syrian Refugees 
Further programming for Syrian refugees in Jordan is a realistic consideration, given the 
potential for a prolonged crisis in Syria and increasing numbers of refugees. The 
following factors will be important for the design of any future work: 

36 See Annex One and the review of secondary data for some findings on these issues. 
37 This included both Save the Children International and Care International. A potential way of doing 
this is with data from GoJ National Aid Fund applications. 
38 From the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MoPIC); however, note that JRC is not 
under the jurisdiction of MoPIC. 


IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


• 
Ability of refugees to return to Syria 
• 
Considerations of any ‘pull-factor’ generated by assistance to Syrians which 
provides incentives for them to stay in Jordan 
• 
The need to include vulnerable Jordanians in longer-term assistance 
programmes, as well as Syrian refugees 
In particular, any future work which seeks to build livelihoods or provide income 
generating opportunities for refugees will have to be designed very carefully around the 
local community context, and be targeted only to those refugees without a realistic 
option to return to Syria. 

Building the capacity of JRC to engage in future programming is essential, as they may 
have a caseload of vulnerable Syrian refugees for the foreseeable future. This 
assessment has highlighted several areas where capacity needs to be built, if this is done 
well it will leave JRC in a stronger position to do more. 

10.4. Scenario Analysis for the Future 
The table below considers three broad scenarios for the near future in terms of refugee 
numbers in Jordan, and potential options for future responses by JRC and RCRC – over 
and above the existing Emergency Appeal. 

Three Broad Scenarios for the Refugee Crisis in Jordan, and RCRC Response 

Scenario for Syrian refugee 
numbers in Jordan 
Characteristics of scenario RCRC Response 
Best case:

Likely case:

Worst case:

Re-assess needs and gaps. 
Consider interventions which 
include poor Jordanians as 
well, to reduce resentment 
and improve acceptability. 
Consider longer-term work 

IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


UNHCR registration lags far 
behind refugee population. 
There is a real possibility that JRC with RCRC support may have to extend the current 
appeal, or consider longer-term interventions, to continue to meet needs. If refugees 
living in the community are not able to return then the most vulnerable will continue to 
face the similar problems that they face now. If a significant gap remains between 
UNHCR registration and the total refugee population, a caseload of refugees who are 
under-assisted will continue to exist. 

Note that UNHCR’s next round of contingency planning is going to assume a worst-
case scenario of 550,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan by April 2013.

• 
Report of Visits to Syrian Refugees, Ramtha and Mafraq, February 2012, Care 
International 
Some of the key findings are detailed below: 

IFRC/JRC rapid assessment39, North Jordan, June 2012: 
In host communities in the north of Jordan, key needs included rent, fresh food, 
medicines and clothes. In most instances, household savings were dwindling fast, as the 
cost of living in Jordan is higher than in Syria. Although some people are managing to 
find work, most are unable to. Rent is listed as the priority need, and there is also an 
increase in the number of people living per household (up to 4-5 families as opposed to 
1-2 previously). Some families are facing eviction. 

Joint GoJ / UN Needs Assessment for Displaced Syrians in Jordan, June 2012 
(assessing Mafraq, Irbid and Amman): 

• 
Refugees are dependant on food parcels and other assistance, have little savings 
and are often in debt. 
• 
Main needs are cash to pay rent, buy fresh food, items for babies and young 
children, and medicines. 
• 
Employment opportunities are limited; most cannot afford the work permit of 
$38840 required for formal jobs which are open to foreigners. Only 12% reported 
having a stable income. Some minors are engaged in labour, as it is easier to find 
work in the informal sector where a work permit is not required. 
• 
Not all needed services are available through the public health system, so 
Syrians have to turn to the private health sector. 
• 
Lack of understanding about UNHCR and its mandate creates rumours about 
privacy and security issues. Feeling that services provided by UNHCR are 
inadequate and do not encourage registration. 
• 
Due to lack of access to the job market, there is a clear preference for cash 
assistance over food and in-kind distributions, which are seen as low quality, not 
corresponding to dietary habits and humiliating, especially when distribution 
takes place in public. 
• 
Some Syrians sell their food parcels as its content does not match their diet, to

40 275 Jordanian Dinar (JD)

generate cash. 

• 
Families were under financial stress for at least a whole year prior to their 
crossing the border. Therefore, their capacity to liquidate assets and bring money 
to Jordan was very limited. Some had to pay their way out of Syria. As a result 
most arrived with little assets and cash. The cost of living in Jordan is almost 
twice of that in Syria. Consequently, most families depleted their reserves in the 
first months after their arrival. 
• 
Food is readily available in Jordan’s markets. Areas near the Syrian border also 
stock food produced from Syrian farms. It is estimated that less than 5% of 
Syrians stay in rural areas, and the majority live in close proximity to urban 
markets with a full range of food items on sale. 
• 
Some Syrians live in governorates which include the “poverty pockets” as 
defined by GoJ. Programming should consider inclusion of the host 
communities in areas of higher poverty, as failing to do so could result in 
animosity from the local community and loss of local support. 
A July 2012 survey by CHF in Amman41 found: 

• 
The majority of Syrians were renting accommodation and despite concerns over 
the high-cost of living in Jordan and increasing rents, most survey respondents 
expect to remain displaced for the foreseeable future. 
• 
For the few who are able to find regular employment, respondents agreed that 
current wages, which for Syrian workers are below standard market rates, would 
be insufficient to cover monthly expenses for an average sized household. 
A July assessment by Acted, in Mafraq and Irbid governates42 also found that: 

• 
31% of interviewed households were female-headed households, constituting a 
vulnerable target group. 
• 
There was a high level of vulnerability among displaced Syrians, with more than 
86% of families having disabled members, infants, pregnant/lactating women, 
elderly, wounded persons or individuals affected by chronic diseases. 
• 
Although 46% of Syrians arrived in Jordan with some savings, ranging from 500 
to 1,000 JD, none of the interviewees stated they have savings left as at June 
2012. 
• 
68 % of interviewees had benefitted from cash assistance since their arrival in 
Jordan, but this has been generally done on a one-time basis only. The majority 
stated that they cannot afford to pay for their rent since cash assistance has been 
discontinued. 
• 
60 % have difficulties in paying for water supply and utilities, and affording 
basic expenses such as food, bottled water, personal and hygiene items, diapers, 
milk and other basic baby items, clothes, transportation, etc. 
• 
95% of interviewees confirmed that Syrians who are working are paid less than 
Jordanians, work long hours, and sometimes are not paid at all.

An August 2012 assessment in Irbid by UPP/Jordanian Women’s Union43 found the 
following (data collected during May-July): 

• 
Most of the refugees surveyed rely on aid to survive, given very limited job 
opportunities. 
• 
While food and NFI distributions have been extensive, cash/rent assistance is 
insufficient and discontinuous. Rental support is considered the most urgent 
need by the great majority of the refugees. 
• 
Education and health seem to be accessible to the majority of the refugees 
• 
Many protection concerns were raised by the participants in the assessment. 
Cases of labour exploitation, discrimination, violence and cheating were raised. 
Child labour and early marriage are acknowledged as occurring among Syrian 
refugees. 
• 
The violence experienced in Syria, together with the difficulty of displaced 
living conditions, have caused psycho-social distress with refugees.

12.Annex Two: Focus group discussion guidance notes 

IFRC/JRC Field Assessment for Syrian Refugees – September 2012 
Focus Group Discussions: Guidance notes and questions 

General guidance: 

The following questions should be used to guide the group discussion. We should try to 
stimulate a discussion among the group, and then record people’s comments and the 
general opinion of the group. Where questions are specific, try and record the range of 
specific answers that the group members give. 
Here are some examples of the type of information we want to record: 

all group members agreed that finding money to pay rent is the biggest problem 
2 of the 7 group members said that they could not afford to pay for medicines for their 
family 
Group members reported paying rent per month ranging from 150 to 250 JD 

We will hold two separate groups in each location – one for men and one for women. 
We should explain carefully our objectives, and that the discussion is confidential. 
People should feel comfortable to express their views honestly. 
It’s important to explain to the group members that we want them to consider what they 
know about the situation for Syrian refugees in general (not just their own experience). 
It’s also important that we explain to people that there is no support being provided 
today, also that being part of this group has nothing to do with participating in a Red 
Crescent project in the future. 


General Questions: 

1-Which part of Syria do you come from? When did you enter Jordan? 


2-How many family members are you staying with in Jordan? Do you have children 
here – how many? 


3-Are you registered with UNHCR? Or another organisation? 


4-Why do some refugees not register with UNHCR? 
(for example – don’t know how to register / afraid to give personal information / don’t 
think it is useful) 


5-Did any of you have to pay money to cross the border from Syria to Jordan? If so, 
how much? 


6-What are your plans for returning to Syria? 
For example – what needs to happen for you to return to Syria? How long do you expect 
to remain in Jordan? 
If you have to stay in Jordan for a long time, how do you expect to live? 


7-What assistance have you received so far in Jordan, and from whom? 
(for example – hygiene kits from Red Crescent, food from UN (WFP), other) 


IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


8-What are the three most urgent needs that you have? 

Housing / shelter situation: 

9 - Where are you living in Jordan – for example renting, staying with another family, 
other? 

10 - Is it easy for refugees from Syria to find somewhere to live (or rent)? 

11 - How is the relationship with the local Jordan community where you live? Is it 
changing? 

12 - What is the average price people pay for rent per month? What about utility costs 
(electricity, water…)? 

13 - Is the shelter they have adequate for their family? In terms of space, quality, access 
to water and sanitation? 

14 - Do they think most Syrian refugees are secure in the places where they live, or is 
their situation uncertain (for example – owner wants them to move soon, can’t afford to 
pay rent, looking for cheaper house) 

Expenditure / Income / Livelihoods: 

Household expenditure 
15 - What are the main items of expenditure for refugee families each month? For 
example - rent, utilities, food, health care, household items/clothes, transport, 
communication, education, others? List on flipchart. 


Exercise: 
Try to put a figure in JD per month against each of the expenditure items. Discuss 
amongst the group, and put the range that everyone agrees with. For example: rent 150300 
JD; utilities 40-60 JD…. 


16 - Have there been changes in the prices of food and other goods in the markets since 
people arrived in Jordan? 


Household income 
17 - What are the main sources of income for refugees? 
For example: wages from casual labour, remittances from family in Syria, gifts from 
family/friends in Jordan, business income, aid (in cash), savings, selling assets, selling 
aid. List on flipchart. 


Exercise: 
First: Rank each income source in order of importance 
If the group finds it easy, then just discuss and rank them 
If this is difficult, use the ‘pair ranking’ method to do this (on the flipchart) 


Second: Try to put a percentage against each income source, to show the proportion it 
makes up of total income (the percentages should add to 100%) 
If the group finds it easy, then just discuss and assign percentages 


IFRC Assessment Report – Syrian Refugees in the Community, Jordan. Sep-12 


If this is difficult, use the ‘proportional piles’ method (use 20 paperclips, and have the 
group allocate paperclips to a pile representing each of the income sources) 

18 - Do many refugees have savings? 

19 - Do many refugees have debt in Jordan? 

Other Livelihoods Information 
20 - What kind of job did most Syrian refugees do in Syria? (trying to understand the 
economic background of refugees) 

21 - Is it possible for Syrian refugees to find work in Jordan? Are you or any family 
members working? 

22 - What is the average daily wage for Syrians in Jordan (discuss if this can be split 
into wages for skilled and unskilled labour)? Are Syrians treated fairly by employers? 

23 - Considering Syrian refugees in general: are there any activities which they have 
started to do in Jordan which they do not normally do in Syria, to help earn money and 
survive? 
For example - working in certain jobs which are new, selling assets, working for or 
helping host families, getting teenage children to work, any others 

Food Security: 

24 - How many meals per day do you and your family normally eat in Syria? How 
many meals a day are you and your family eating currently? 

25 - What is your opinion of the food distributions are you receiving? 
26 - If you think about all the food your family eats in a month, what proportion of it is 
given to you and what proportion do you purchase? 


27 - Do you have all the kitchen items you need to cook with? 


Other Questions Relevant to Cash Programmes: 

28 - Do you think it is best for refugees in Jordan to be given food, hygiene kits, 
household kits; or is it better for them to be given cash? Why? 
29 - What is the first thing you would spend cash on if you were given it?
