EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 

In February 2013, the Regional Office for the Near East and North Africa and the Emergency and 
Rehabilitation Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) 
undertook a “comprehensive analysis of the impact of the Syria crisis on the agriculture sector, 
agricultural-based livelihoods, and the food and nutrition security in the Near East Region and, 
in particular, its influence on markets and trade routes, restrictions of imports and export flows, cross-
border agricultural commodity/input supply flow, prices and livelihoods”. The main output of the 
analysis is a comprehensive document that: (i) identifies the major impacts of the Syria crisis on the 
agriculture sector, and on the food and nutrition security of neighbouring countries (i.e. Egypt, Iraq, 
Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey); and (ii) presents the immediate and medium-term needs related to food 
and nutrition security and agricultural-based livelihoods of displaced people, returnees, host 
communities and other vulnerable groups in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey through the 
development of regional and national response plans for the crop and livestock subsectors. 

 

As of 1 March 2013, there were an estimated 1.1 million Syrian refugees registered or waiting to be 
registered in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. This number does not include people who are 
not registered, Syrian seasonal workers who remain in Lebanon (estimated at 250 000–
300 000 people), Lebanese and Iraqi returnees (estimated at 30 000 and 50 000 people, respectively) 
and Palestinian Syrians (an estimated 25 000–50 000 people). The actual number of people who have 
fled Syria to these neighbouring countries is thus significantly higher and well in excess of 
1.7 million. 

 

Regional and national macro-economic situation – trade, inputs and labour 

 

The Syria crisis has compounded the already difficult economic situation in the majority of Syria.s 
neighbouring countries. While overall economic growth is slowing down in all neighbouring countries 
(i.e. Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey), exports, tourism and transportation have all been 
negatively affected owing to the interruption of trade routes and the deterioration of regional and 
national security. 

 

While the Syria crisis is affecting all sectors in neighbouring countries, its impact on the agriculture 
and food sectors is particularly important being the main source of income for a significant proportion 
of the population, particularly for the poorest segments in rural areas and vulnerable communities. 
While the share of the agriculture sector in gross domestic product ranges from 4 percent in Jordan to 
over 15 percent in Egypt, the sector employs the majority of the rural population in these countries. 
Importantly, agriculture is the main source of livelihood for the majority of communities hosting 
Syrian refugees in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. With its strong forward and backward linkages 
within rural settings and with other sectors of the economy, agriculture is a major source of stimulus 
for growth and income generation in these countries. 

 

Syria is a major trading partner for all of its neighbouring countries in food and agriculture and a 
major transit route to and from the countries of Eastern Europe and the Near East Region, in particular 
to the Gulf States. However, the crisis has disrupted agricultural and food trade in the region. Four 
changes in agricultural trade flows in 2011 and 2012 are worth noting: (i) a decline in total 
agricultural trade; (ii) a considerable drop in bilateral agricultural trade with Syria and in transit trade 
through Syria; (iii) a significant change in trading routes in the region; and (iv) increased informal 
trade across the borders with Syria. 

 

The disruptions in trade have had negative impacts on small-scale producers and workers along the 
supply chains of most agricultural commodities. The communities living close to the borders with 
Syria have been affected the most as a result of lost jobs and declines in farm businesses. In Turkey, 
for example, Syrian refugees are bringing their crops, particularly olives, into Turkey to sell their 
fruits on local markets well below market prices – resulting in a considerable fall in local commodity 
prices to the detriment of Turkish farmers. Shortages of subsidized wheat flour and now high prices of 
that flour have led to industrial action by bakers in Lebanon and shortages of poultry products in 
Jordan (formally imported from Syria), resulting in a three- to four-fold increase in the price of eggs. 


In addition, the risks associated with food quality and safety, and threats of transboundary animal and 
plant diseases and pests have increased as a result of the informal trade and the changing trade routes. 

 

Because of the Syria crisis, trade routes for food and agriculture are changing, posing significant 
challenges for neighbouring countries given the associated increases in transport costs and the need 
for increased infrastructural capacities in terms of port facilities, storage and other logistical 
requirements. Previously, agricultural commodities travelled through Syria over land, mostly in 
refrigerated trucks. Now countries are using longer land routes with less insecure journeys through 
Syria, sea routes such as from/through Mersin in Turkey, Beirut in Lebanon, Haifa in Israel, Port Said 
in Egypt and Aqaba in Jordan to markets in Iraq and countries in the Arabian Peninsula, or even air 
transportation (particularly Beirut). The change in trade routes has mostly been accompanied by a 
change in destination markets, which calls for additional investment to meet quality requirements of 
the new markets. In addition, the change in trade routes raised the urgent need to strengthen border 
food quality and safety control in ports to which agricultural trade is being diverted. 

 

The availability of agricultural inputs (e.g. seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, farm machinery, animal feed 
and medicines), which are predominantly imported into Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon, has been 
disrupted and costs of imports have increased in most of the countries. On the whole, agricultural 
inputs were heavily subsidized in Syria; border communities of Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey had 
been benefiting from cheaper agricultural inputs and regular income from the informal trading and 
smuggling of such goods prior to the crisis. The crisis has disrupted the flow of agricultural inputs, 
leading to a significant increase in agricultural production costs in border areas. In Lebanon, Lebanese 
returnees are „panic. selling their dairy cattle at one-third of market prices due to high animal feed 
costs, lack of winter grazing lands as well as a need to finance immediate household living costs. 

 

The Syria crisis has resulted in an inflow of a large number of refugees and migrant workers into 
neighbouring countries. On one hand, this has helped a few productive sectors such as construction 
and large-scale agriculture (with their lower salary demands), but on the other hand it has created a 
displacement of traditional migratory labour sources (e.g. Egyptians in Jordan and northern Turks in 
Turkey). 

 

Overall, the continued civil unrest in Syria has raised serious concern over the state of food security in 
the neighbouring countries of Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon and the Middle East Region as a whole, 
particularly among the vulnerable communities of border areas, including those communities hosting 
refugees. The increased stress on resources, water and food – coupled with a decline in income and 
economic activity – is adding a tremendous strain on neighbouring countries at the national, local and 
household levels. 

 

The Syria crisis is affecting food availability in neighbouring countries through: (i) the negative effect 
on local food productive capacities, mostly because of the security situation in border areas; (ii) the 
increased demand for food as a result of the growing influx of refugees and returnees from Syria and 
increased fiscal burden to maintain food subsidies; and (iii) the considerable fall in imports of food 
products from Syria. It is also affecting access to food through its overall negative impact on 
household incomes and increased cost of food. The closure of the borders and the decreased ability of 
producers to export their products to Syrian markets, as well as to other markets transiting through 
Syria (e.g. Turkey, Eastern Europe and the Arabian Peninsula), have resulted in loss of income to 
farming communities and many of the people working along the food and agriculture commodity 
chains. Increased competition from refugee workers with local workers has also resulted in reduced 
household incomes in host communities. 

 

Local socio-economic situation (refugees, returnees and host communities) 

 

It is estimated that more than two-thirds of refugees and returnees from Syria are located outside of 
refugee camps (including 100 percent in Egypt and Lebanon), being hosted by communities who 
themselves are increasingly under threat of food insecurity and poverty. It is further estimated that 
60 percent of these people are located in small towns and villages where agriculture is the primary 
source of livelihood. The initial Syrian refugees were of urban origin, but since mid-2012 the majority 
have been rural – most of them abandoning unharvested crops, livestock as well as personal and 


productive (farm) assets. With the exception of Egypt and Kurdistan Regional Governorate of Iraq, 
refugees and returnees are located in some of the poorest areas, or „poverty pockets. of the 
neighbouring countries to Syria (i.e. parts of northwestern Iraq, northern Jordan, northern and eastern 
Lebanon and southeastern Turkey). 

 

Priority needs for refugees throughout the five hosting countries of Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and 
Turkey are mostly related to security, affordable and decent accommodation and access to more stable 
income sources to maintain livelihoods and cover household needs. Insecurity is higher among non-
registered refugees – who are the most vulnerable to being exploited by employers and reliant on host 
communities to assist them with their basic needs of food and shelter. 

 

Host communities in these countries may both benefit and suffer from the availability of Syrians as 
cheaper labour, as well as the cheaper agricultural products coming with those who cross from Syria. 
The coping strategies of host communities and refugees in all border areas are being seriously eroded 
as time passes, food prices are unstable and rental prices in some host communities increase 
drastically. In general, affected communities in neighbouring countries can be classified into four 
categories: 

 

i. Communities hosting Syrian refugees and returnees: affected by increasing rents, increased 
pressure on household resources and access to food, increased competition and availability of 
labour, etc. 
ii. Communities neighbouring refugee camps: affected mostly by the availability of surplus labour 
and competition with local labour, possible changes in food prices and shortages in energy and 
other services as a result of the growing demand from camps, possible market opportunities for 
local farm produce (e.g. in Jordan and Turkey) and possible loss of agricultural land (e.g. 
Turkey)1. 
iii. Communities in close proximity to the border affected by violence and insecurity: directly 
affected by the security situation and border conflict, cannot access their farmland or move 
freely, and may need to relocate internally (e.g. Lebanon and Turkey). 
iv. Communities where livelihoods are highly engaged and interacting with communities in Syria: 
including traders, seasonal labourers, cross-border relatives or farmers (e.g. Iraq, Jordan, 
Lebanon and Turkey) who used to obtain their subsidized agricultural inputs and services from 
Syria and now face loss of income and degraded livelihoods as a result of higher input costs and 
loss of markets for their products, increased competition and availability of labour, etc. 


1 While refugee camps have been built on public land, there are cases where this land was cultivated. 

 

In most cases, affected communities are actually a mix of one or more of these four categories, 
particularly in Jordan and Lebanon. 

 

To cope with the growing pressure of the crisis on affected communities in neighbouring countries, 
including the increasing influxes of refugees and returnees, there is an urgent need for increased 
income opportunities for host communities. This is necessary in order for these communities to be 
able to cope with the pressure, feed themselves and strengthen their potential to assist the refugees. 
Equally, creating income-generating opportunities for refugees will help them meet their basic needs 
of food and other necessities and will minimize pressure on local communities. All of these efforts 
should be designed and implemented judiciously, creating a „win-win. situation between host 
communities and refugees without jeopardizing decent employment. 

 

Transboundary animal and crop diseases and pests, and environmental threats 

 

Transboundary animal diseases (TADs) such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), peste des petits 
ruminants (PPR), bluetongue, brucellosis, lumpy skin disease (LSD), highly pathogenic avian 
influenza (HPAI) and bovine tuberculosis are generally reported in the Near East Region but, as a 
general rule, they are monitored and checked. However, veterinary services inside Syria (e.g. TADs 
surveillance, animal vaccination and quarantine) collapsed in 2012. Uncontrolled livestock movement 


has increased significantly – only Turkey has a strict and efficient border control system with the 
slaughtering of all non-registered animals. Unvaccinated live animals are being legally imported or 
illegally crossing into Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon, with minimum or zero quarantine, for sale on the 
open market and slaughter houses throughout those countries. 

 

FMD, PPR, bluetongue, brucellosis, LSD and cutaneous leishmania have all been unofficially 
reported in the Syrian border areas of Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon (but not all declared by the respective 
governments). PPR, bovine tuberculosis and rabies have been reported in captured and slaughtered 
animals in Turkey. Although not a country bordering on to Syria, Egypt has its own serious livestock 
and poultry disease problems. Repeated incursions of new strains of FMD viruses and the ongoing 
HPAI outbreaks are the biggest hurdles facing the livestock subsector. Egypt has also reported cases 
of PPR in 2012 and LSD has been endemic for a number of years. The peak seasons for outbreaks of 
most TADs in the region are April and November. Moreover, nomadic Bedouins and agropastoralists 
from Syrian border areas of Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon can no longer access free or subsidized Syrian 
vaccines and animal feeds. 

 

Veterinary services in Iraq and Lebanon are weak – with limited surveillance and reporting of TADs, 
animal quarantine facilities and registered animal vaccination programmes – and are not capable of 
managing the threat of emerging TADs from Syria. Veterinary services in Jordan are inconsistent – 
whereas Jordanian animals are registered and vaccinated, TADs surveillance and animal quarantine 
systems are weak in Syria border areas. Only Turkey can claim to possess an animal health system 
that can effectively manage the threat of TADs spreading from neighbouring countries such as Syria. 
This is due to the fact that the country has invested a lot in this field and also received considerable 
financial and technical support from the European Union to control TADs and prevent them from 
spreading to Turkey.s western borders with Europe. Egypt is a special case, where FAO.s global 
Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Disease Operations is already assisting the Ministry of 
Agriculture to control TADs through a multi-donor funded project running since 2005 – a project 
which could quickly be scaled up to address the increasing threat of TADs in the region. 

 

The increasing amount of smuggled agricultural commodities from Syria to Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and 
Turkey and the opening up of new trade routes without adequate sanitary and phytosanitary controls, 
significantly increases the risk for crop diseases and pests to spread, particularly tomato leaf miner, 
wheat rust and fruit flies – already prevalent in Syria and increasingly so in Jordan and Lebanon. 

 

Two environmental threats related to the Syria crisis of note are: (i) traditional transhumance grazing 
systems of the Badia rangelands of southern Syria, northeastern Jordan and northwestern Iraq have 
been seriously disrupted (with no access to winter pastures in Syria), leading to overgrazing and land 
degradation in Jordanian and Iraqi border areas; and (ii) the Government of Jordan is extremely 
concerned about the effects of increasing pressure on the local aquifer around the Zaatari Syrian 
Refugee Camp, with competition for water with large-scale irrigated farmers, and potential pollution 
from poor waste disposal systems from the camp. 

 

National and international responses to the Syria crisis 

 

The United Nations Syria Regional Response Plan (and its three revisions) identified the following 
priority areas of intervention: (i) the provision of food assistance, non-food items and/or financial 
assistance; (ii) access to healthcare and education; and (iii) quick impact projects in host communities 
struggling to cope with the additional strain on their infrastructure. The Kuwait Donor Conference of 
30 January 2013 focused on pledges for funding protection, shelter, food assistance and health 
through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations 
Children.s Fund, the World Food Programme and the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
There is an urgent need for the next Regional Response Plan under revision to address the increasing 
threat of transboundary animal and crop diseases and pests emerging from Syria, the deteriorating 
condition of food traded across official and unofficial border crossings, increasing malnutrition among 
farming families of host communities and the medium-term needs of rural host communities to 
recover their food production and income-generating functions following the shock of the Syria crisis 
in the border areas of Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey and peri-urban areas of Egypt. 

 


However, a sub-meeting of agencies (held in Amman, Jordan) of the United Nations (UN) Seventh 
Syria Humanitarian Forum of 19 February 2013 concluded there to be strong needs for: (i) follow-up 
with all countries (especially from the Gulf States) having made pledges during the donor conference 
in Kuwait on how funds will be channelled and priorities defined; (ii) linking emergency response to 
medium-term recovery and long-term rehabilitation and development – agriculture was mentioned as 
a key sector in this domain; (iii) developing strong contingency plans, as the end of the crisis is 
uncertain: (iv) increasing UN assistance to refugees, and even more so to host communities. This 
„subgroup. expressed a strong interest in FAO.s regional assessment to analyse the impact of the 
Syria crisis on the agriculture sector of host countries/communities and requested an early release of 
its findings and recommendations. It is clear that there is now a strong shift towards providing 
additional support to host families in the Syria border areas of Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey 
(most of which are from poor farming communities) and in Egypt.

nutritious and affordable produce to Syrian refugee camps and host communities (two years; 
USD 4 300 000). 
. Enhancing income generation and nutritious food production through the introduction of small-
scale household food processing facilities in the Zaatari Refugee Camp and among host 
communities of Syrian refugees in the border areas of Jordan (two years; USD 616 000). 
. Increased household egg production among host communities of Syrian refugees in the border 
areas of Jordan (one year; USD 1 100 000). 



 

Lebanon 

. Emergency vaccination and feeding of Bedouin herds grazing in areas along the Syria-Lebanon 
border (one year; USD 5 200 000). 
. Relieving the suffering of returnees and host communities in the impoverished Syria border 
areas of Lebanon through the recovery and rehabilitation of smallholder agricultural production 
and marketing (two years; USD 7 500 000). 


 

Turkey 

. Support to „micro-gardening. initiatives for improved food nutrition and income generation in 
selected Syrian refugee camps of Turkey (one year; USD 506 000). 
. Recovery and rehabilitation of smallholder agricultural production and marketing in the 
impoverished Syria border areas of Turkey (two years; USD 12 000 000). 


 

The overall cost for the two regional and 13 national response programmes and projects is estimated 
at USD 65.5 million. 

 

FAO.s comparative advantage to coordinate and oversee these response plans for the agriculture 
sector in the Near East Region can be summarized as follows: 

. Building on FAO.s unique expertise and mandate on issues related to transboundary animal and 
crop diseases and pests – through its global Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary 
Animal and Plant Pest and Diseases, Global Framework for Transboundary Animal Diseases, 
Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Disease Operations, International Plant Protection 
Convention, Wheat Rust Disease Global Programme and regional Integrated Pest Management 
Networks. 


 

. Using FAO.s expertise on food processing, sanitary and phytosanitary measures – through its 
global leadership of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, International Network of Food Data 
Systems and Food for the Cities Network. 


 

. Unfolding FAO.s mandate on food security and agriculture-based livelihoods programming in 
conflict- and disaster-affected regions and countries of the world (e.g. Democratic Republic of 
the Congo, West Bank and Gaza Strip, Iraq, Pakistan, South Sudan, the Sudan and Yemen). 


 

. Building on FAO.s country programmes and partnerships with Ministries of Agriculture, and the 
use of recently completed and ongoing agricultural food security projects from which lessons can 
be learned and emergency and early recovery responses can be launched.

1. INTRODUCTION 

 

The escalation of the violence in Syria in 2012 has led to a sevenfold increase in the number of Syrian 
refugees who have fled to the neighbouring countries of Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. In 
March 2013, there were over 1.1 million Syrian refugees registered or waiting to be registered in the 
above countries. Estimates including Iraqi and Lebanese returnees, Syrian refugees and Palestinian 
Syrian refugees who are not registered mean that the total number is much higher. Syrian refugees 
have generally been welcomed by host governments and many local communities continue to extend 
hospitality and assistance in spite of their own often limited means. While most borders remain open, 
the strain on local resources is substantial and relentless as more refugees seek safety with little means 
to survive, often having already experienced displacement, impoverishment and severe deterioration 
of overall conditions in their own country. For those who arrived earlier, life in exile is proving 
increasingly difficult to sustain as their initial resources start to dwindle. 

 

Meanwhile, host countries are facing their own domestic challenges. From political and social unrest 
to a difficult economic period, the context of the humanitarian response is extremely complex, 
exacerbated by the fear that the Syrian conflict may spread into neighbouring countries. This makes it 
all the more urgent and vital for the response to receive increased support from the international 
community, demonstrating the will to share the heavy burden borne by host governments and their 
populations. The challenge of responding to the specific refugees, returnees, and host community 
populations for Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey requires understanding of their respective 
circumstances. In this context, the Syria crisis has disrupted the agriculture sector of each country at 
both national and/or local (Syrian border area) levels. This includes trade (i.e. imports, exports and 
transiting of food commodities), food prices, labour movements, food and nutrition security, 
transboundary animal and crop diseases and pests, and environmental threats. 

 

Map 1. Near East Region affected by the Syria crisis 

 

 

In February 2013, the Regional Office for the Near East and North Africa (RNE) and the Emergency 
and Rehabilitation Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) 
undertook a rapid analysis of the impact of the Syria crisis on the agriculture sector, agricultural-based 
livelihoods and food and nutrition security in the region. In particular, it examined the influence of the 
crisis on disruptions to markets and trade routes, restrictions of imports and export flows, cross-border 
agricultural commodity/input supply flow, prices and livelihoods. The analysis also explored the 
effects of the increased presence of refugees and returnees in the neighbouring countries of Egypt, 
Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey on food supply and demand in host communities. In this context, 
the analysis studied the impact of the crisis on the volume and value of border agricultural produce 
and food trade, the movement of agricultural labour and its overall implications for the economies of 
the host countries in general and for the hosting communities in particular, in terms of local price 


changes, gains or losses related to income and income-generating activities, loss of local and/or 
foreign markets and other associated economic, social and environmental risks. 

 

To facilitate this analysis, FAO-RNE mobilized a multidisciplinary mission to Egypt, Jordan, 
Lebanon and Turkey. Working with the FAO Representations and offices of those countries, the 
mission undertook desk studies, drew checklists, held stakeholder consultations through group 
meetings and semi-structured interviews and carried out field visits to refugee camps and host 
communities to gather all background information, assess needs and prepare response plans. 

 

During its mission, the FAO Team consulted with: 

. Ministries of Agriculture (and Food, Livestock and Land Reclamation), of Industry and Trade 
(and Economics), and of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) of the respective governments; 
. regional, subregional and country offices of United Nations (UN) agencies2; 
. regional, subregional and country offices or embassies of development partners3; 
. international and national Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs), community-based 
organizations (CBOs), chambers of commerce, and exporters. and producers. associations; and 
. focus groups of Syrian refugees, Lebanese returnees, and host communities for those refugees 
and returnees in Egypt and the border areas of Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.

Migration (IOM), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR), United Nations Human Settlement Programme (HABITAT), United Nations Office for the 
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations 
Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), World Food Programme (WFP) 
and World Health Organization (WHO). 

3 Including the International Centre for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), Canadian International 
Development Agency, International Monetary Fund, European Union, United Kingdom/Department for 
International Development (DFID), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), World Bank, 
MoFA of the Government of Turkey, and Governments of Australia, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, 
Finland, France, Hungary, Italy, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates. 

 

For the Iraq assessment, the Team consulted with the FAO Programme for Iraq in Amman, Jordan, as 
well as the Iraq offices of other agencies, which are also based in Amman. 

 

The main output of the analysis is a document that: (i) indentifies the major impacts of the Syria crisis 
on the agriculture sector and on the food and nutrition security of the neighbouring countries; and 
(ii) presents the immediate and medium-term needs in relation to food and nutrition security and 
agricultural-based livelihood support to displaced people, returnees and host communities and other 
vulnerable groups in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. 

 

This document will be used by FAO and other concerned stakeholders, including Ministries of 
Agriculture and their national and international development partners, to strategize agricultural and 
food security responses to the Syria crisis at regional and national levels. Notwithstanding the 
differences between the situations and the needs of refugees, returnees and host communities in the 
different countries, the analysis was able to ensure harmonization of standards across the Near East 
Region and will facilitate the establishment of successful programmes, particularly in areas that 
require more focus in the coming months and years. 

 

 


2. BACKGROUND 

 

2.1 Consequences of displacement 

 

2.1.1 Numbers of refugees 

 

As of 18 March 2013, an estimated 1.2 million Syrian refugees were registered or waiting to be 
registered in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. This number does not include refugees who 
are not registered, Syrian seasonal workers remaining in Lebanon (an estimated 250 000–
300 000 people), Lebanese and Iraqi returnees (an estimated 30 000 and 50 000 people, respectively) 
and Palestinian Syrians (an estimated 25 000–50 000 people). The actual number of people who have 
fled conflict in Syria to these neighbouring countries is therefore significantly higher and in excess of 
1.7 million, although very difficult to estimate. For example, in Egypt alone, while the number of 
Syrian refugees who are registered and waiting to be registered totals 30 000, the actual estimated 
number is between 150 000 and 180 000, and the Lebanese Government estimates that there are 
1 million Syrians and returnees in Lebanon alone. Further details are provided in Table 1.

1/ IOM has reported repatriating a maximum of 300 Egyptians from Syria. 

2/ Jordan does not allow entry of Palestinian refugees from Syria populations, unless they have Syrian documentation. 

3/ The population of the Kurdish Region, where the majority of Syrian refugees are located, is 3.8 million. 

4/ This is a conservative estimate as reports indicate that between 40 and 50 percent of Syrian refugees in Lebanon are 
neither registered nor awaiting registration. 

 

It is estimated that more than two-thirds of these refugees and returnees are located outside of refugee 
camps (including 100 percent in Egypt and Lebanon), being hosted by communities who themselves 
are increasingly under threat of food insecurity and poverty. It is further estimated that 60 percent of 
these are located in small towns and villages where agriculture is the primary source of livelihood. 

 

2.1.2 Location of refugees, returnees and host communities 

 

With the exception of Egypt (where refugees are hosted in urban areas) and to some extent Jordan, the 
majority of Syrian refugees are camped or hosted in rural areas with low population densities. 
However, in the cases of Jordan and Lebanon, these areas are relatively close to large urban 
populations such as Amman, Irbid, Beirut and Baalbek. 

 

(i) Egypt 

 

Egypt is host to an estimated 150 000–180 000 Syrian refugees, living in mainly urban and peri-urban 
areas. In greater Cairo, Syrians are concentrated in the following areas: 6th of October, Al Haram, 
Faysal, Al-Obour, Nasr City and Al-Rehab. Outside of Cairo, Syrian populations are located mainly 
in the Nile Delta area in Alexandria, Damietta, Mansoura, or in Ismailia, Suez and Hurghada. 

 

(ii) Iraq 

 

The majority of Syrian refugees in Iraq are located in Duhok, Sulaimaniyah or Erbil of the Kurdish 
Region. They are also located in a number of areas across Anbar, Kirkuk and Ninewa Governorates 
and some are also reportedly located in southern Iraq. Three refugee camps exist: (i) at Domiz in 
Dohuk Governorate (with a population of between 35 000 and 45 000); (ii) at Al Qaim in Anbar 
Governorate (with a population of 8 500); and (iii) at Al Waleed, also in Anbar Governorate 


(no information available). There are also a number of transit facilities existing in public buildings, 
such as schools. However, Syrian refugees may register at Domiz Camp and travel to a number of 
locations throughout Iraq in search of employment. Syrian refugees in the Kurdish Region were 
initially located primarily in urban settings, with smaller numbers located in rural areas. However, 
latest information indicates an increased number located in rural areas4. Iraqi returnees are mainly 
located in Baghdad Governorate, followed by Anbar, Ninawa, Diyala, Nasiriya, Babil, Kurdish 
Region, Kirkuk and Salah Al Din Governorates. While Iraqi returnees are more likely to be living 
with host families, Syrians are more likely located in camps, transit facilities, rented apartments and, 
to a lesser extent, with host families. 

4 There are REACH assessments currently ongoing in Duhok and Erbil Governorates by UNHCR and Agency 
for Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED), which will result in more details on the socio-economic 
profiles of refugee populations in these areas. 

 

(iii) Jordan 

 

In Jordan, it is estimated that between 110 000 and 140 000 Syrian refugees are located in Zaatari 
Refugee Camp. The remainder is located in the Governorates of Irbid, Mafraq, Balqa, Ajloun and 
Amman, which (with exception of Amman) are a mix of urban and rural land use with considerable 
agricultural activity. In order to cope with the influx of refugees and the inability of Zaatari Refugee 
Camp to take on more refugees, two transit facilities exist: Cyber City and King Abdullah Park. A 
new refugee camp in Zarqa has been completed but is not yet operational. 

 

(iv) Lebanon 

 

Syrian refugees, Lebanese returnees and Palestinian refugees from Syria (PRS) are spread out among 
approximately 700 locations in Lebanon, across all districts. It is estimated that Syrian refugees are 
found mainly in Akkar and North Lebanon (47 percent), Bekaa (38 percent), South Lebanon 
(7 percent), Mount Lebanon (5 percent) and Beirut (3 percent). The highest concentrations of Syrian 
refugees and Lebanese returnees are located in rural, agricultural districts, while PRS populations are 
located mainly in existing Palestinian refugee camps, with Saida hosting the largest PRS populations 
(29 percent). 

 

(v) Turkey 

 

The Government of Turkey has reported 185 000 Syrian refugees living in 17 refugee camps across 
eight provinces, with an additional 100 000–120 000 registered Syrian refugees living in non-camp 
settings, mainly in the provinces of Gaziantep (20 000), Hatay (50 000), Kilis (30 000) and Sanliurfa 
(20 000). Non-camp populations are likely much higher considering the number should non-registered 
populations be included. Non-camp populations are located in a mix of urban and rural settings, and 
these provinces are large agricultural areas. It is anticipated that the Syrian population of Kilis town 
will double over the next six months, to two-thirds of the town.s total population. Certain districts 
have large populations from particular areas in Syria; for example in Altinozu District of Hatay 
Province, there are high concentrations of refugees from Idleb, as opposed to Lattakia or Aleppo. 

 

2.1.3 Socio-economic profiles of refugees, returnees and host communities 

 

(i) Egypt 

 

Refugees 

 

Syrian refugees in Egypt are largely of urban origin, with Homs, Damascus and Aleppo being the 
main cities of origin. Limited profiling information is currently available; however, a joint assessment 
of UNHCR, the United Nations Children.s Fund (UNICEF) and WFP obtained some preliminary 
information about Syrian households. Syrian refugees in Egypt are comprised of some skilled 
professional workers of a variety of professions, labourers and small-business owners – almost all of a 
non-agricultural background. Syrians who arrived in Egypt with some savings had only planned to 
survive on these for a short period and after lack resources to support themselves. In terms of age and 


gender, 45 percent of Syrians registered with UNHCR are under 18 years of age, 48 percent are men 
and women between 18 and 59 years (similar numbers of men and women) and 4 percent are over 
60 years. As such a low number of people are registered, these demographics may be quite different 
among the non-registered populations, particularly considering that households with children may be 
more inclined to register in order to access the services provided to registered populations. 

 

Refugees must often abandon their initial plans of finding employment in their area of expertise and 
consider jobs at lower wages and outside of their field. Once initial savings have run out, Syrian 
families are often relying on their neighbours for assistance with housing or food, at least in the short 
term. The majority of Syrians are willing and able to work, but are unable to find employment. The 
main obstacles for Syrians to generate income in Egypt were cited as: (i) a lack of capital to start 
businesses; (ii) insufficiently low wages; and (iii) lack of knowledge of labour demand and 
opportunities. It was often cited that Syrians who arrived earlier had more resources to start 
businesses and were reported to be providing employment to the more newly arrived Syrians. 
Additionally, it was reported that Syrians have been opening small restaurants, mainly concentrated in 
6th of October, and selling or processing foods5. Additionally, many Syrians in Damietta are working 
in furniture-making industries and reportedly originate from a specific Damascus suburb. 

5 For example shawarma, hummus, mana.ish, kibbeh (kobebah), pickled vegetables, and processed dairy 
(cheese, etc.). 

6 Al-Qaim border crossing is currently closed to Syrian refugees, with the exception of those with emergency 
medical needs and those joining families, but continues to be open to Iraqi returnees. 

 

Host communities 

 

No profiling has been undertaken on the host communities where Syrian refugees are settled; 
however, as the locations are urban and peri-urban areas, they are generally a mix of socio-economic 
classes engaged in a wide variety of income-generating activities. Overall, the areas where Syrian 
refugees are located (greater Cairo, Damietta, Alexandria, etc.), may demonstrate higher development 
indicators than the rest of Egypt. However, specific neighbourhoods will vary greatly in these same 
indicators. Syrians are not located in areas of Cairo where high concentrations of the poorest 
Egyptians reside; for example, 6th of October City has lower unemployment rates and illiteracy rates 
than Egypt as a whole. However, Syrians are undoubtedly living or working in close proximity to 
Egyptians, from relatively poorer to wealthier households. 

 

(ii) Iraq 

 

Refugees and returnees 

 

Syrian refugees in Iraq originate from a combination of urban and rural areas and over 40 percent of 
registered refugees were males between the ages of 18 and 59. Their skill sets vary, from jobs in 
agriculture, to public service, private businesses and (semi-)skilled labour. Syrians in the Kurdish 
Governorates originate from areas in Al-Hassakeh Governorate (62 percent), but also from as far 
away as Aleppo (14 percent) and Damascus (13 percent). Syrian refugees to the Kurdish Region are 
almost entirely Kurdish in ethnicity. Most non-Kurdish Syrian refugees are located in Anbar 
Governorate6, are of Arab ethnicity, originated from rural areas in Deir-ez-Zor Governorate and came 
to Anbar Governorate due to family or tribal linkages. While profiling information is not yet available 
on Syrian refugees in the Kurdistan Regional Governorate (KRG), agriculture was the largest 
employer in Deir-ez-Zor and Al-Hassakeh Governorates, employing 30 percent of the labour force, 
followed by the service sector. These governorates are also major producers of wheat and cotton for 
Syria, while Aleppo is a mix of urban and rural populations, with olives being an important 
agricultural product for the governorate. 

 

Little to no information is available on the profiles of Iraqi returnees, although reports indicate that 
they were residing in urban areas such as Damascus and Homs. 

 

The majority of displaced Syrians and Iraqis returning from Syria are relying on savings or assistance 
from relatives to manage financially. In addition, despite the fact that there appear to be employment 


opportunities in the Kurdish Region, the majority of refugees have not found stable sources of income 
and have limited savings to support themselves for longer periods of time. A rapid assessment 
conducted by IOM in August 2012 reported that 63 percent of the Syrian families indicated that they 
plan to integrate locally in Iraq, and none indicated plans to return to Syria in the near future. Of the 
assessed Iraqi returnees, 67 percent reported that they intend to integrate locally and only 6 percent 
plan to return to Syria. 

 

Host communities 

 

The KRG is significantly wealthier than the rest of Iraq, with poverty ranging from 3–13 percent. 
Approximately two-thirds of the KRG population live in urban areas. However, half the number of the 
poor are in rural areas, which reveals that the economy and social conditions in rural areas are 
considered a poverty-generating environment. The poor.s economic activities in rural areas are 
concentrated in agriculture (56 percent), as well as building and construction (14 percent). They take 
jobs that require no high skills or education. As a result, agriculture tends to disappear and most 
people are looking for employment for stable incomes; this sometimes leads to stable incomes but 
diverts the young labour force from productive sectors, including agriculture. Those who remain 
engaged in agriculture are pluri-active for their economic survival. In particular, pluri-activity reduces 
vulnerability to drought and water scarcity. Most of the agricultural activities are only undertaken on a 
part-time basis (either seasonally or daily). 

 

The KRG is rich in fertile land. However, policies of prior regimes in Iraq saw productivity of the 
agriculture sector reduce significantly, coupled with a high rate of urbanization. The Government is 
now working on incentives to encourage populations to move to rural areas and engage in agricultural 
activities. Agriculture is viewed as a major opportunity for poverty reduction in the area. On average, 
each farmer cultivates 10 hectares of land. 

 

Anbar Governorate has one of the highest development indicator rankings when compared with other 
Iraqi governorates and its economy is centred on agricultural production, employing 25 percent of 
Anbar's workforce. The most important agricultural crops in Anbar are wheat, barley, maize, potatoes, 
vegetables and fodder crops. Cross-border trade with Jordan is an important part of the province's 
economy. However, it is viewed as insecure in terms of security issues due to ongoing conflicts. 
Anbar Governorate also hosts a large number of internally displaced people owing to the conflict in 
Iraq, so pressure may have already existed on host communities prior to the crisis in Syria. 

 

(iii) Jordan 

 

Refugees 

 

Approximately 68 percent of Syrian refugees in Jordan originate from Dara.a Governorate in Syria 
and are from mainly rural backgrounds, while another 20 percent originate from Homs Governorate. 
Dara.a is a governorate where 15 to 20 percent of the population is considered poor and is an 
important area for agricultural production. Homs is the largest governorate in Syria, highly populated 
with the city of Homs and concentrates a large number of farmers in the west, while the central and 
eastern part of the governorate has a low population density dominated by herders. Homs is 
considered relatively wealthy, with poverty not exceeding 7–10 percent of its population. A recent 
assessment undertaken by UNHCR and ACTED demonstrated that males comprise approximately 
47 percent of refugees and females 53 percent. Approximately 56 percent of the registered refugees 
are under 18 years of age. Of the non-camp registered population, 34 percent are female-headed 
households, while 27 percent are single males. Syrians have often been displaced within Syria before 
arriving in Jordan. Due to the collapse of facilities and the deterioration of the situation in Syria, 
people arriving recently may have more urgent needs, have already eroded their coping mechanisms 
(limiting their ability to survive without assistance) and be in more desperate conditions when they 
reach Jordan. 

 

Many of the male refugees were providing seasonal labour to the large-scale irrigated farms of border 
areas; however, now they have brought their whole families and, on the whole, stayed in host 
communities previously known to them. 


Host communities 

 

The main governorates where refugees are living are Irbid, Mafraq, Balqa, Ajloun and Amman, which 
vary greatly in terms of populations and socio-economic characteristics. The majority of the 
populations in these governorates reside in urban areas (similar to Jordan as a whole), where 
urbanization7 ranges from 94 percent in Amman to 76 percent in Ajloun. The exception is Mafraq, 
which is 60 percent rural. Irbid, which has the highest numbers of refugees, is also the most densely 
populated governorate in Jordan. Incidence of poverty is higher in rural areas (19 percent) than in 
urban areas (10 percent) in Jordan overall. Poverty incidence varies considerably among the 
governorates, from a high of 23 percent in Mafraq, to a low of 9.4 percent in Amman. On the other 
hand, the total number of poor Jordanians is highest in Amman (comprising 28 percent of total poor) 
and Irbid (17 percent), while lower in Mafraq (8 percent) – meaning the largest numbers of poor 
people are not found in the poorest governorates. At the same time, while the majority of the poor are 
urban, the highest incidence of poverty („pockets.) is found mostly in subdistricts in rural areas, where 
some are in isolated and remote areas, while others are merely in areas with a poor resource base. 

7 In Jordan, any town with a population greater than 5 000 is considered urban. 

8 It is estimated that there are 200 000 non-Jordanian workers in low to unskilled professions, including 
agriculture, 150 000 with work permits and the remainder working illegally. 

 

Jordan experiences a non-diversified economic outlook, focused on the development of industry and 
services, while leaving the agriculture sector underinvested. The implications of single sector 
dependence and the underutilization of land and agriculture are evident in the high rates of rural and 
urban unemployment across the country. Rural Jordan.s rich earn less than 10 percent of their total 
per capita income from agriculture and more than 55 percent of it from non-farm sources. At the 
country level, only 2.3 percent of households are engaged in the agriculture sector as their primary 
source of income, while 26 percent are engaged in service and sales. However, the agriculture sector 
relies on non-Jordanians for labour (62 percent of agricultural labour is non-Jordanian, mainly 
Egyptian, and to a lesser extent Syrians and Iraqis). Because non-Jordanians often do not have official 
work permits, official numbers are difficult to determine8. 

 

(iv) Lebanon 

 

Refugees and returnees 

 

Syrian refugees in Lebanon come from all governorates across Syria, as far east as Al-Hassakeh 
Governorate. However, they mostly originate from the western governorates, primarily Homs (45 
percent), followed by Damascus, Idleb, Aleppo and Hama Governorates, all of which previously had 
high levels of agricultural production. A number of refugees in Akkar and Bekaa have farming and 
herding backgrounds and experience; demographics suggest that refugees are comprised of whole 
families. Syrian refugees and, to a much greater extent, Lebanese returnees may have some family or 
community ties in locations where they are arriving, particularly in the north and border areas where 
they are more likely to be staying with host families than renting apartments. 

 

It is estimated that the Syria crisis has affected some 30 000 poor smallholder Lebanese returnees who 
have been farming inside Syria for generations; however, as Lebanese citizens, they are not entitled to 
register as refugees and benefit from available entitlements of returnee status. Like Syrian refugees, they 
have lost all of their household and farming assets, access to subsidized Syrian agricultural inputs and 
the ability to generate income through cross-border trading in such goods. In addition, the Lebanese 
relatives with whom they are staying are now also hosting their former Syrian neighbours (many of 
whom are living in unsanitary tented accommodation). These highly vulnerable returnees are now 
hosted in some 136 villages of all districts bordering Syria, most of which represent the poorest areas of 
the country (e.g. Akkar, Baalbek, Hasbaya, Hermel and Marjaayoun) that were already the target of the 
Government of Lebanon.s social safety-net programmes prior to the Syria crisis. 

 

 


Host communities 

 

Refugees and returnees are overwhelmingly located in the northern and eastern areas of Lebanon, 
with Akkar, Zahle, Baalbek and Tripoli having the highest numbers of registered refugees. Poverty is 
prevalent in the mainly rural areas of Akkar, North and South Lebanon and Baalbek-Hermel Districts. 
The distribution of poverty coincides as well with the destination of Syrian refugees, where their 
economy is dependent on trade with Syria, particularly smuggling/trafficking of goods and livestock 
rearing. Prior to the crisis in Syria, economies in the north and border communities were dependent on 
trade with Syria, particularly smuggling/trafficking of goods, livestock rearing and trade, agriculture, 
construction and cross-border transportation. Prior to the Syria crisis, an assessment by IOM in Akkar 
and Menyeh/Danniyeh Districts revealed that support to agriculture was a priority need of hosting 
communities. Host communities, particularly poor rural households, have experienced shocks to their 
livelihoods due to instability in Lebanon prior to the crisis in Syria; as a result, their capacity to take 
on this additional shock may be limited, particularly as the crisis persists. 

 

 (v) Turkey 

 

Refugees 

 

Syrians refugees – generally full families – have arrived mainly from Aleppo, Idleb, and Lattakia 
Governorates and to a lesser extent Damascus, Hama and Homs Governorates. These refugees are from 
both urban and rural backgrounds and, in the case of non-camp populations, many have ties with those 
communities where they choose to stay. Only one profiling activity was undertaken and is available in 
English9. A large number of unregistered and a few registered Syrian refugees are working as seasonal 
workers in the agriculture sector throughout the southern provinces of Turkey. 

9 Carried out by the NGO Support to Life; although other Turkish NGOs have done some assessments, these are 
not available in English. 

 

Host communities 

 

Communities in the southern provinces of Turkey host the largest numbers of refugees, both in and 
out of camps. Isolated incidences of conflict have been reported, but in general the response is of 
viewing Syrians as guests. Economies of these areas vary greatly – with Gaziantep being based on 
medium- to large-scale food processing and manufacturing industries and larger scale farming, 
whereas other border provinces have large areas of small-scale family farming with cross-border trade 
forming important livelihoods for host communities. 

 

2.2 Importance of agriculture to the region’s economy 

 

While the Syria crisis is affecting all sectors in neighbouring countries, its impact on the agriculture and 
food sector is particularly important. The sector is the main source of income for a large proportion of the 
population, particularly for the poorest segments in rural areas and vulnerable communities. The share of 
the sector in GDP ranges from 4 percent in Jordan to over 15 percent in Egypt, but it employs the majority 
of the rural population in these countries (see Table 2). Importantly, agriculture is the main source of 
livelihood for the majority of communities hosting Syrian refugees in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. 
With its strong forward and backward linkages within the rural sector and with other sectors of the 
economy, agriculture is a major source of stimulus for growth and income generation in these countries.

Map 2. Agricultural production of Syria and its neighbouring countries 

 

2.2.1 Land use and crops 

 

(i) Egypt 

 

Less than 4 percent of Egypt.s land cover is agricultural land (i.e. the irrigated flood plain and delta of 
the River Nile). Egypt.s main crops are rice, maize (half of which is grown for fodder), cotton and 
sugar cane. Food legumes, forage crops, citrus and vegetables, particularly beans, Egyptian clover, 
oranges, tomatoes and potatoes are also important crops. In Egypt, total populations of buffaloes, 
cattle, goats and sheep are similar (i.e. 4–5 million of each) – reared under smallholder traditional 
extensive systems (including nomadic and semi-nomadic), semi-intensive mixed farms and intensive 
industrial systems in peri-urban areas (including 10 percent of cattle). Goat populations are more 
concentrated in the Upper Egypt and Middle Egypt regions, and sheep in the Upper Egypt and 
Western Delta regions, while buffaloes and cattle are concentrated in the Middle Egypt and Middle 
Delta regions. Egypt has a total population of some 100 million chickens, 60 percent of which are 
reared in intensive units of peri-urban areas. 

 

(ii) Iraq 

 

About one-quarter of the total land area of Iraq is suitable for intensive cultivation and animal rearing 
– much of the remainder is the “western desert”. A considerable part of Iraq.s agricultural land lies in 
the hilly and mountainous northwestern parts of Iraqi Kurdistan and along the Tigris and the 
Euphrates flood plains of the southeast. 

 

Two different agro-ecological zones are found in border areas with Syria. In northeastern Iraq, 
Kurdistan.s agricultural wealth of high-grade pasturelands has long made it suitable for a pastoralist 
economy, but it is equally suitable in many areas for intensive agriculture, in particular rainfed barley 
and wheat production. The pasturelands have remained in reasonably good condition and continue to 
be a productive source of animal feed. The rich pastures have always ensured that in all historical 
periods, regardless of how dominant the agriculture sector, there have been nomadic herders 
exploiting this economic niche to its fullest. Despite its potential, agriculture is at present declining 
significantly in KRG. Northwestern Iraq is characterized by very low and erratic rainfall and is only 
used for late-winter and early-spring grazing of nomadic sheep, goats and camels (as part of the Badia 
rangelands of Jordan and Syria). 


(iii) Jordan 

 

Farming systems in Jordan are mainly dependent upon the availability of water. Owing to the scarcity 
of water and low rainfall, only 380 000 hectares are suitable for cultivation and only 17 percent of this 
area is irrigated, which accounts for less than 0.1 hectare per capita. Under rainfed conditions, 
140 000 million hectares are planted with winter crops (e.g. wheat, barley, lentil, broad bean and 
forage crops). The area planted with summer crops is around 8 100 hectares (i.e. chickpeas, sesame, 
maize and tobacco), and 8 000 hectares are planted with vegetables (e.g. tomato, eggplant, squash, 
cucumber, cabbage, onion, potato, watermelon, lettuce, spinach and okra). A further 70 000 hectares 
are planted with fruit trees and around 10 000 hectares with forage crops. 

 

The northeastern border areas with Syria are characterized by the Badia (semi-desert) rangelands, 
where the significant land use is nomadic pastoralism. Western-central areas (where the Haatari 
Syrian Refugee camp is located) are arid and barley cultivation, irrigated fruit trees and pastoralism 
are predominant. Western areas (around Irbid city) are semi-arid and predominantly under wheat 
cultivation and irrigated vegetables, with some fruit trees. 

 

(iv) Lebanon 

 

Lebanon's annual agricultural production is estimated at 2.7 million tonnes, with a total value of 
USD 1.2 billion. Agriculture is mainly concentrated in the Bekaa Valley (40 percent), North 
(25 percent), South (20 percent) and Mount Lebanon (15 percent) Regions. Agricultural production 
essentially comprises vegetables (47 percent), fruit (35 percent), cereals (15 percent) and olives. Fruit 
production mainly consists of citrus (i.e. orange, lemon, mandarin and grapefruit), followed by grapes, 
apples and bananas. Vegetable production mainly concerns potatoes, followed by tomatoes and 
cucumbers. The main cereals produced are forage crops, wheat and barley. 

 

Governorates of Akkar and Baalbek: Akkar is characterized by two farming systems: (i) terraced 
hillsides with fruit trees, in particular olives; and (ii) the Akkar plain with smallholder mixed farms of 
irrigated tobacco, citrus, vegetables, cereals and legumes, sometimes with a few dairy cattle. Akkar is 
also renowned for its poultry farms, producing more than 60 percent of Lebanon.s eggs. The northern 
Bekaa valley of Baalbek is characterized by arid rangelands where large populations of small 
ruminants are concentrated, with nomadic, semi-nomadic and sedentary herding systems. Where 
irrigation is available (from small mountain springs), typical land use includes almond and apricot 
orchards and small dairy farms with forage crops. 

 

(v) Turkey 

 

Turkey enjoys a comparative advantage in many agricultural products. The country exports cereals, 
pulses, industrial crops, sugar, nuts, fresh and dried fruits, vegetables, olive oil and livestock products. 
The main export markets are the European Union and the United States of America (to which Turkey 
primarily exports dried fruit and nuts, cotton and tobacco) and the Middle East (which primarily 
imports fresh fruit, vegetables and meat from Turkey). With a production of some 33 million tonnes 
of cereals, Turkey is largely self-sufficient (close to 90 percent) and import requirements do not 
exceed 4 million tonnes per year. The influx of some 300 000 Syrian refugees does not change 
significantly the national food balance. 

 

In Antioch, Gaziantep and Kilis Provinces – where a large number of refugees settled – agriculture is 
dominated by rainfed and irrigated cereals, olives, cotton, citrus and maize. The region is highly 
important for sheep and goat meat production. The Provinces of Urfa and Mardin (southeastern Anatolia 
Region) are characterized by large fertile plains in southern parts neighbouring Syria. These provinces 
also benefit from Turkey.s largest irrigation scheme, the ongoing South-Eastern Anatolia Project. 
Agriculture is dominated by rainfed cereals and food legumes, as well as irrigated cotton. Despite its 
agricultural potential, the poorest people live in the country.s least developed areas in eastern and 
southeastern Anatolia and parts of the coastal regions on the Black Sea. The poorest rural people are 
self-employed and unpaid family workers. They include small-scale farmers and their households, as 
well as people who live in remote and isolated areas. Women and unemployed young people are 
particularly disadvantaged. Incomes in those areas are 40 percent lower than the national average. 


2.2.2 Livestock production systems and their contributions to agricultural livelihoods 

 

According to various sources, the contribution of the livestock subsector to agricultural GDP is 
30 percent for Egypt, between 40 and 60 percent for Iraq, 55 percent for Jordan, 27 percent for 
Lebanon and 30 percent for Turkey. In particular, dry and arid areas of the neighbouring countries to 
Syria mainly rely on livestock for food security, nutrition, subsistence, employment and overall 
agricultural livelihoods. At present, it is estimated that there are total of 51.9 million sheep, 
11.3 million goats, 14.3 million cattle, 390 000 buffaloes, 238 000 camels and 363 million chickens in 
Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Turkey. 

 

Figure 1 shows the total of equivalent livestock units10 in Syria and its neighbouring countries. 
Although possession of livestock in countries like Jordan and Lebanon seems low compared with 
larger countries such as Turkey, livestock are largely raised by the poor in the marginal areas, mostly 
in areas bordering Syria, which are the most affected by the Syria crisis.

Sheep and goat production systems 

 

Sheep and goats are the main species of livestock adapted to a range of climate variability and dryness 
of the region. Awassi is the only adapted sheep breed that connects Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and 
Turkey. It is perhaps one of the few breeds able to survive the fluctuating feed availability resulting 
from desertification and recurrent droughts. Its fat tail provides a reserve of nutrients for periods of 
feed shortage. In Syria, local mountain goats are kept and graze in the mountain ranges close to forest 
areas and supplemented with some concentrates at night. The Shami or Damascus goat is called the 
„cow of the poor family.. The Shami goat produces up to 600 kg of milk per lactation and is raised in 
mostly intensive or semi-intensive systems similar to dairy cattle. 

 

Depending on the availability of grazing, finance and technical background, different production 
systems can be seen in countries neighbouring Syria: 

 

(i) nomadic system: animals depend on natural pasture as flocks move from one place to another, 
on foot or by truck, in search of grazing or water (e.g. Upper Egypt, northwestern Iraq and 
Syria; largely practiced in arid to semi-arid regions); 
(ii) semi-nomadic or transhumant system: animals move between semi-arid grazing areas and 
cropping areas, depend partially on natural grazing and partially on crop by-products, and spend 
winter mostly around the homesteads (e.g. Middle Egypt, northeastern Iraq, Jordan and Syria); and 
(iii) settled (semi-extensive) system: sheep and goats graze natural pasture during the day, return to 
their (fattening) units each day and feed on crop by-products while supplementary feeds are 
provided as required (e.g. Western Delta region of Egypt, northeastern Iraq and Lebanon). 



Cattle production systems 

 

Cattle are largely kept for dairy and some for beef. There are two production systems: 

 

(i) intensive system: largely practiced by medium- and large-sized farms (particularly in peri-
urban areas of Egypt and Turkey), run for commercial purposes; animal feeds are procured in 
large quantities or accessed by the producers with no subsidies available to them, and cattle are 
kept in barns with small occasional grazing or relaxing pasture land available to them; and 
(ii) small-scale dairy production system: very common in most of these countries, with farm size 
varying from one to ten dairy cows; local breeds are largely being replaced by Holstein Friesian 
cows which resulted in, for example, a sharp decline in adapted Shami cattle of Syria and Baladi 
cattle of Jordan. 


 

Poultry production systems 

 

There are four types of poultry production systems in the Near East Region: 

 

(i) industrial integrated system: has farms that are part of an integrated broiler production 
enterprise with clearly defined and implemented standard operating procedures for biosecurity 
(e.g. peri-urban areas of Egypt, Jordan, Turkey and Syria); 
(ii) commercial poultry production system with moderate to high biosecurity: farms with birds 
kept indoors continuously, strictly preventing contact with other poultry or wildlife (e.g. more 
rural parts of Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Syria); 
(iii) commercial poultry production system with low to minimal biosecurity and a caged layer 
farm with birds in open sheds: farms producing chickens and eggs with poultry spending 
some time outside the sheds (e.g. Egypt, northeastern Iraq and Lebanon); and 
(iv) village or backyard production with minimal biosecurity and birds/products consumed 
locally: all neighbouring countries, including Jordan where poultry production is low. 


 

2.3 FAO and its partners in agricultural recovery and development 

 

2.3.1 FAO’s Strategic Framework, 2010–2019 

 

FAO.s Strategic Framework for the period 2010 to 2019 has a vision that by 2020, we will be living 
in a “world free of hunger and malnutrition where food and agriculture contribute to improving the 
living standards of all, especially the poorest, in an economically, socially and environmentally 
sustainable manner”. 

 

This will be achieved through the active pursuit of three global goals: 

(i) Reduction in the number of people suffering from hunger, progressively ensuring a world in 
which all people at all times have sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary 
needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. 
(ii) Elimination of poverty and the driving forward of economic and social progress for all, with 
increased food production, enhanced rural development and sustainable livelihoods. 
(iii) Sustainable management and utilization of natural resources, including land, water, air, climate 
and genetic resources, for the benefit of present and future generations. 


 

Added to these global goals, strategic objectives and priority areas, FAO has also identified 
six guiding principles to underpin the Organization.s development work in countries such as Pakistan, 
viz: (i) work through participatory and process-oriented approaches; (ii) build on existing knowledge, 
methods and capacities; (iii) ensure complementarity of actions and links with other stakeholders and 
actors; (iv) focus on capacity development of rural communities and all other stakeholders of the food 
chain; (v) focus on gender equity; and (vi) promote “do no harm” and “rights-based” approaches. 

 


In order to achieve the Vision of FAO and the Global Goals of its Members, the Organization has 
defined five Strategic Objectives (SOs). They focus on where FAO can best assist Member States to 
achieve sustainable impacts in addressing the challenges and opportunities facing food, agriculture 
and rural development. The SOs represent a combination of interlinked and cross-sectoral impacts, 
addressing the areas of crops, livestock, fisheries, food safety, forestry, natural resources, enabling 
environments, food security, gender, emergencies and investment. 

 

The five SOs include: 

 

SO1: Eradicate hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition 

SO2: Increase and improve provision of goods and services from agriculture, forestry and 
fisheries in a sustainable manner 

SO3: Livelihoods of rural populations and, in particular for women and youth, are improved 
through enhanced employment opportunities and conditions, increased access to productive 
resources and rural services 

SO4: Enable more inclusive and efficient food and agricultural systems at local, national and 
international levels 

SO5: Increase the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises 

 

The focus of the Agriculture Response Plan to the Syria Crisis is therefore in areas of direct relevance 
to FAO.s SO5, while supporting the other four SOs. 

 

2.3.2 FAO’s regional priority areas 

 

In 2012, FAO-RNE defined five Priority Areas for the region (including Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and 
Lebanon). The focus of the Agriculture Response Plan to the Syria Crisis is in areas of direct 
relevance to FAO-RNE.s Priority Area E, “preparedness for, and response to, food and agriculture 
emergencies”. It also supports Priority Area A, “enhancing food security and nutrition”; Priority 
Area B, “fostering agricultural production and rural development for improved livelihoods”, and 
Priority Area D, “sustainable management of natural resources”. 

 

FAO.s Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia is preparing a Regional Priority Framework. In 
this context, the FAO Subregional Office for Central Asia (SEC), which includes Turkey, has 
submitted six draft Priority Areas for inclusion in the Regional Framework. The focus of the 
Agriculture Response Plan to the Syria Crisis is in areas of direct relevance to FAO/SEC.s Priority 
Area 1, “strengthening food security and nutrition, both within the subregion and outside”; and 
Priority Area 4, “control of animal, plant and food-borne pests and diseases”. 

 

2.3.3 FAO’s Country Programming Frameworks 

 

The priority areas for FAO.s collaboration with Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey have been 
closely aligned with those agreed by the UN System with the Governments and their Ministries of 
Agriculture in the context of their respective United Nations Development Assistance Frameworks 
(UNDAFs). The FAO Country Programming Frameworks (CPFs) for Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and 
Turkey and the Road Map for Agriculture in Iraq11, which have been prepared through their own 
extensive stakeholder consultations, cover a similar period to their respective UNDAFs (i.e. 2012 to 
2015, 2016 or 2017). The priority areas of the CPFs and the Road Map are also consistent with FAO.s 
global and regional priorities (see Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2). 

11 The CPF for Iraq is under preparation; however, its priority areas will be similar to those of the Government 
of Iraq/FAO Partnership for Agricultural Development.s “Road Map for Agriculture (2012 to 2016)”. 

 

The CPFs and the Road Map for Agriculture in Iraq are co-owned by the Governments of Egypt, Iraq, 
Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey and FAO. They present the broad commitment of FAO (subject to the 
availability of the required funding) to assist the respective Ministries of Agriculture (and Food, 
Livestock and Land Reclamation) in their efforts to achieve development objectives as articulated in 


national policies and strategy frameworks for agricultural development. The priority areas of the 
four CPFs and the Road Map relevant to the Agriculture Response Plan to the Syria Crisis are 
outlined in Annex 1. 

 

2.3.4 FAO’s ongoing initiatives in the Near East Region 

 

FAO and its development partners have recently completed or are presently implementing a series of 
agricultural programmes and projects in the Near East Region from which lessons can be learned and 
emergency and early recovery responses can be launched (Annex 1.1 to 1.6, inclusive). 

 

These include: 

 

. promotion of urban and peri-urban farming and household food and nutrition security in Egypt; 
. enhancing community livelihoods and micro-industries and strengthening veterinary services 
for the control of transboundary animal diseases (TADs) in Iraq; 
. improvement of rangeland management and promotion of conservation agriculture in Jordan; 
. recovery of the dairy sector, strengthening the production and marketing of agricultural 
products and supporting emergency livelihoods of vulnerable returnees in Lebanon; and 
. capacity development for analysis and strengthening of agricultural innovation systems, 
initiative for pesticides and pest management and enhancing organic farming in Turkey. 


 

Five regional programmes of note include: (i) the control of TADs in the Middle East Region 
(see below); (ii) strengthening veterinary quarantine capacity in the Middle East Region; (iii) regional 
integrated pest management (IPM) in the Near East; (iv) management of tomato borer in the Near 
East Region; and (v) policy and technical support for countries at direct risk of new virulent races of 
wheat rust (see Annex 1.6). 

 

Following the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks in the region, the FAO global 
Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Disease Operations (ECTAD) established a Regional 
Animal Health Centre for the Middle East (RAHC-NE) in Beirut in 2007 through an agreement 
between FAO, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Ministry of Agriculture of 
Lebanon. The RAHC-NE played an important role in regional coordination protection efforts related 
to human and animal health, timely implementation of effective TAD control strategies that have led 
to progressive disease control, increases in animal production efficiencies, the opening of new 
markets for healthy livestock and trade of animal products. 

 

A lack of sustained financial support led to the closure of RAHC-NE in 2011. However, FAO-
ECTAD has retained a national TAD programme in Egypt (see Annex 1.1) – where there is an ISO-
accredited animal disease diagnostic laboratory (i.e. the National Laboratory for the Quality Control 
of Poultry Production), which has been supported by FAO over the past decade. Furthermore, Turkey 
has ISO-accredited and Biosafety Level 3 Category laboratories (i.e. double-door access zone and 
sealed penetrations), a strong technical capacity for laboratory analysis, and extensive and effective 
public veterinary services – again, supported by FAO in recent times. 

 

2.3.5 International Centre for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas 

 

Prior to the Syria crisis, the headquarters, laboratory and gene bank of the International Centre for 
Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) were located in Aleppo, northern Syria. In 
December 2010, ICARDA relocated its international staff, experts, facilities and much of its 
equipment from the organization's headquarters and principle research station to other offices, mainly 
in Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt and Ethiopia. No damage had been done to the gene bank, and the genetic 
material of the different crops are all safe as both the government and opposition forces have 
protected and maintained them. ICARDA is also in the process of decentralizing its organizational 
structure with the aim of creating five hubs: (i) Headquarters and West Asia (based temporarily in 
Beirut and Amman, with the aim of returning to Aleppo, Syria); (ii) Nile Valley (Cairo, Egypt); 


(iii) North Africa (Rabat, Morocco); (iv) Central Asia (Tashkent, Uzbekistan); and (v) sub-Saharan 
Africa (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia). 

 

ICARDA.s Regional Programme for West Asia includes some 25 projects which focus on: providing 
agricultural research institutions in the region with plant material for their breeding programmes on 
barley, wheat, lentil, chickpea, faba bean, vetch, grasspea and medic; reversing land degradation 
through water harvesting and planting of fodder shrubs on the Badia rangelands of Jordan and Syria; 
improving water use efficiency through collaborative work on land and water management; IPM in 
Iraq though the implementation of farmer field schools (in collaboration with the International Fund 
for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and USAID-funded “Middle East Water and Livelihood 
Initiative”; pilot village-level wastewater treatment units in Jordan; conservation of genetic resources 
in Jordan; and developing technological, institutional and policy options on agricultural research. 

 

FAO and ICARDA have recently prepared memoranda of understanding on the characterization, 
conservation and management of plant genetic resources. Since 2005, FAO and ICARDA have been 
collaborating in: 

. germplasm and crop development; 
. seed production; 
. natural resource management; 
. livestock management; 
. information management and exchange; and 
. human capacity development. 


 

Another important model for working with FAO is the regional platform of partnership in the Asia 
and Pacific Region where FAO, the Asian Development Bank, IFAD, the World Bank, WFP and 
ICARDA are working in partnership with the national agriculture systems in countries of the region. 
Such partnerships outline ICARDA.s responsibilities with regard to agricultural research and FAO.s 
responsibility to agricultural policy development, extension and capacity building in any given region, 
subregion, country and/or agro-ecological zone. 

 

2.3.6 International Fund for Agricultural Development 

 

IFAD is a specialized agency of the UN that provides finance for agricultural development and food 
security projects in remote and rural areas of developing countries. Like FAO, IFAD.s headquarters 
are located in Rome, Italy. IFAD is currently funding ten projects in the neighbouring countries to 
Syria, with a total investment of USD 253 million. Prior to the crisis, IFAD was financing three 
projects in Syria, with a total investment of USD 65.7 million – one of which was a national 
“Integrated Livestock Development Project” (2011–2019; USD 28 million). 

 

Four projects upon which lessons can be learned and/or an agricultural response to the Syria crisis 
could be built include: 

 

(i) “Promotion of Rural Incomes through Market Enhancement Project” in Egypt (2012–
2020; USD 71.1 million); 
(ii) “Jordan Agricultural Resource Management Project”, which aims to improve food and 
water security and income levels through community-based participatory approaches (2005–
2015; USD 11.8 million – co-financed by Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries 
[OPEC] for USD 10.3 million); 
(iii) “Hilly Areas Sustainable Agricultural Development Project” in Lebanon, which aims to 
raise the productivity of smallholder farmers affected by recent wars and enhance processing 
and marketing services of local enterprises (2012–2018; USD 4.6 million – co-financed by 
OPEC [USD 8.4 million] and the Government of Spain [USD 9.4 million]); and 
(iv) “Diyarbakir, Batman and Siirt Development Project” in Turkey, which implements village 
improvement programmes for the poorest areas through the establishment/expansion of new or 
existing rural businesses (2007–2013; USD 24.1 million). 



3. SITUATION ANALYSIS 

 

The Syria crisis – which emerged in early 2011 and worsened dramatically in 2012 – has compounded 
the already difficult economic situation in the majority of Syria.s neighbouring countries. The 
growing influxes of refugees and returnees, the dramatic disruption in trade in the region and the 
heightened uncertainty have all affected the neighbouring countries of Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon 
and Turkey. These developments have induced considerable loss of farm incomes, increases in 
transportation and food costs, falling tourism and remittances, and dwindling investments. 

 

3.1 Regional and national macro-economic situation 

 

This section identifies the impact of the crisis on Syria.s neighbouring countries of Egypt, Iraq, 
Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, drawing on a rapid assessment of the overall economic trends, food and 
agricultural trade performance, changes in trading routes, availability of agricultural inputs, 
movement of agricultural labour, and the consequent overall effects on availability and access to food. 

 

3.1.2 Overall economic trends 

 

Beyond agriculture and food security, the Syria crisis is impacting on all sectors of the economy and 
the overall macro-economic stability of neighbouring countries. All basic sectors have been affected 
by the crisis to varying degrees across the countries. Exports, tourism and transportation have all been 
negatively affected due to the interruption of trade routes and the deterioration of regional and 
national security. The Syria crisis has aggravated existing economic problems of neighbouring 
countries. Even before the crisis, most of the neighbouring countries showed slowdown in their 
overall economic growth. 

 

In Egypt, tourism revenues, one of the main foreign exchange contributors, and foreign investment 
are still recovering from the political and economic events of 2011. Inflation in the country has soared 
up to 9 percent. Economic growth in Egypt has been stifling at 2 percent, with foreign reserves 
dwindling by half over the past year. The economy has been struck by illiquidity, hard currency and 
investment flight. 

 

While Iraq is witnessing economic growth due to rising oil exports, this has failed to transfer into the 
local economy. The return of Iraqi refugees back to Iraq because of the conflict in Syria is putting 
increased pressure on local economies. In September 2012, the consumer price index (CPI) in Iraq 
increased by 6.4 percent compared with September 2011. Food inflation increased by 7.8 percent 
during the same period. 

 

According to the Jordanian Department of Statistics, the monthly rate of food price inflation (year-on-
year) in Jordan in August 2012 reached almost 6 percent. The Government faces a particularly high 
budget deficit of USD 2.8 billion due to increasing energy import costs and the high burden of 
subsidies. The Jordanian economy is nearing stagnation – growth has been suffering due to the 
decline in foreign investments, with an optimistic 3 percent GDP growth. The International Monetary 
Fund (IMF) has approved a loan of USD 2 billion for Jordan to give the country time to correct the 
imbalances in the budget and the balance of payments, while maintaining social stability. Pressed by 
budgetary issues and fiscal deficit, the Government is considering streamlining the current subsidy 
system. Direct cash payments to deliver subsidies to targeted segments are being considered. 
However, with the increasing number of refugees, the removal of subsidies will worsen the disparities 
between refugees and host communities – adding to the challenges facing refugees to access food. 

 

Lebanon.s growth in GDP this past calendar year has gone down significantly to 1 percent or less 
from 3.5 percent in 2011 – and the prospects for 2013 are just as grim. Lebanon, primarily dependent 
on the tourism and services sector, has lost most of its clientele in the Gulf States, which 
compromised more than 75 percent of international non-Lebanese visitors. Although, in the past, food 
inflation in the country was consistently higher than general inflation, the pattern reversed in 
July 2012. While general inflation increased by about 4 percent in December 2012 (year-on-year), 
food inflation stabilized at around 6 percent. The Government is struggling to develop a national 


policy towards the Syrian refugee influx, due not only to its political intricacies, but primarily to deal 
with the fiscal challenges. With a high GDP to debt ratio, an annually increasing debt service, 
declining government revenue and a stagnant economy, the Government must seek international aid 
and support. 

 

Even Turkey, with its increasing global economic presence, has suffered a reduction in economic 
growth, with IMF estimating GDP growth at 3 percent for 2012. While this might be related to other 
global trends, the Turkish economy is certainly being negatively affected by the complications arising 
from the Syria crisis (i.e. increased number of Syrian refugees and border insecurity) and the trade 
restrictions imposed by Turkey on Syria. Latest figures in Turkey (November 2012) indicate a lower 
annual food inflation rate of 4.3 percent, while the overall CPI in November 2012 stood at 6.4 percent 
– the lowest for the last 13 months (Turkish Statistical Institute). Increases in the cost of housing, 
water, electricity, gas and other fuels are mostly localized in areas close to the Syrian border. 

 

3.1.3 Agricultural trade and marketing 

 

Syria has a unique position as a trade crossing point in the Middle East, a port of access to Eastern 
Europe, Central Asia, Russia and Turkey for Middle Eastern countries and vice versa. Thus, Syria is a 
major trading partner for all its neighbouring countries. Before the crisis, Iraq, for example, received 
one-third of Syria.s exports, while Lebanon shipped around 20 percent of its agricultural exports to 
Syria. However, the crisis has disrupted agriculture and food trade in the region, with negative 
consequences on producers and other stakeholders along the agriculture and food commodity chains. 
Four developments in agricultural trade flows in neighbouring countries in 2011 and 2012 are worth 
noting: (i) a decline in total agricultural trade; (ii) a considerable drop in bilateral agricultural trade 
with Syria and in transit trade through Syria; (iii) a significant change in trading routes in the region; 
and (iv) increased informal trade across the borders with Syria. 

 

The assessment of the agricultural trade situation draws on data and information gathered from 
Syria.s neighbouring countries, including Ministries of Trade and Industry, customs authorities, 
chambers of commerce, exporters and producers. associations, cross-border traders and retailers in 
border areas, and other sources. 

 

Deterioration in total and bilateral agricultural trade 

 

Total agricultural exports have slowed in 2012 in Jordan and Lebanon and declined sharply in Egypt 
and Turkey. Annex 2 (Tables 1 to 5) summarizes recent trends in total agricultural trade of Syria.s 
neighbouring countries, as well as their bilateral agricultural trade with Syria. In the neighbouring 
countries for which data were available, agricultural exports to Syria have shown considerable decline 
in the period 2011–2012, exceeding 50 percent in Egypt and Turkey, and more than 25 percent in 
Jordan. Similarly, agricultural imports from Syria fell by more than 30 percent in 2012 compared with 
the average of 2009–2010 for Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt. Reportedly, formal trade between Syria 
and Turkey has declined significantly and had almost completely stopped in late-2012. 

 

While there are some other factors that may contribute to the decline in agriculture and food trade, the 
Syria crisis and its consequences are seen as the key factor behind the decline of intraregional trade in 
food and agricultural commodities during 2011 and 2012, particularly in the case of Lebanon and 
Jordan. Disruptions to trade across the region occurred because of the security situation, the 
consequent increase in transport costs and the occasional closure of borders at some crossing points. 
Land freight costs have increased significantly in all countries. 

 

The impact of the Syria crisis has been more pronounced on neighbouring countries. agricultural trade 
that transit through Syria. Much of the agricultural trade (exports and imports) of Lebanon with Iraq, 
Turkey, Ukraine and Saudi Arabia used to take place by land through Syria. Similarly, much of the 
bilateral agricultural trade of Jordan with Russia, Ukraine and Turkey was through Syria. Iraq, Turkey 
and Egypt also have a significant part of their agricultural trade with Eastern Europe, Turkey and GCC 
states that go through Syria. Bilateral agricultural trade of Jordan and Lebanon with Iraq, Ukraine and 
Turkey have fallen sharply in 2012 compared with 2010, as shown in Annex 2, Tables 6 and 7. 

 


While available data could not allow full assessment, it is reported that some of Syria.s neighbouring 
countries may have benefited from trade diversion as a result of the crisis by replacing Syria in some 
of its fruit, vegetable and livestock markets in countries such as the GCC states. Although there are 
signs that some countries have benefited from such trade diversion, the overall effect of the crisis on 
agricultural trade flow remained negative. This has negatively affected producers of exportable 
commodities and those working along the respective chains. The Jordan Exporters and Producers 
Association for Fruit and Vegetables reported that many farmers in the Jordan Valley had to throw 
away large amounts of their vegetable produce because of the export constraints and the sharp 
increase in transport costs. Similarly, large quantities of citrus fruit, apples and olive oil could not be 
exported in Lebanon, resulting in great losses for farmers and traders. Informally imported products 
from Syria have also led to a sharp drop in local farm prices in Turkey and Lebanon, particularly for 
products such as olive oil, grapes and apples. 

 

The impact of the Syria crisis on animal feed trade has also been severe, seriously impacting 
smallholder livestock keepers of neighbouring countries. Jordan used to import the bulk of its animal 
feeds from Ukraine through Syria at a cheaper price than other sources. As a coping mechanism, 
Jordanian entrepreneurs have now resorted to importing animal feed through Haifa port at great 
expense (and considerable bureaucracy and security checks), which has significantly increased the 
feed price on the local market. Annex 3 provides more country-specific information on animal feed. 

 

Changes in trade routes 

 

A major feature of agricultural trade in the region is the dominance of land transport, mostly using 
refrigerated trucks. Most of the trading in agricultural commodities with and through Syria and its 
neighbouring countries is made through land routes. For Lebanon, Syria is the only land trade route to 
Iraq, Turkey and the Gulf, which is by far the largest market in the region. Similarly, land routes 
through Syria are the main outlet for agricultural trade of Jordan with Turkey and Eastern Europe. 
Governments of neighbouring countries have so far been able to minimize the impact on consumers 
and producers by finding new trade routes and absorbing some of the increased costs. Exporters of 
horticultural products in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Egypt are experiencing difficulties coping with 
the new trading routes given the high perishability of their products, which are primarily shipped 
through refrigerated trucks. The alternative marine transportation is costly and also unsuitable for a 
variety of highly perishable horticultural products. According to the Jordanian Association of Fruit 
and Vegetable Exporters, farmers in the Jordan Valley have lost more than 23 000 hectares of 
vegetables as a result of export bottlenecks in 2012. 

 

Al-Qa.im border crossing between Syria and Iraq (one of the major supply routes across the Middle 
East) has been closed to commercial traffic for more than a year. The other two crossing points 
between Syria and Iraq – Al-Waleed and Rabi.a – witnessed repeated closures, making the trade with 
Syria highly unpredictable. Trade between Lebanon and Syria through border crossings of Al-Masnaa 
and Al-Arida have also been disrupted, and more of the agricultural trade has been moved to Beirut 
and other sea ports in Lebanon. In Jordan, a significant volume of agricultural trade has been shifted 
away from Ramtha border crossing to Haifa in Israel through Al-Jasr and to Al-Aqaba port in the Red 
Sea. Trade routes in Turkey have also been gradually moving to Mersin port applying a „rolled on and 
rolled off. shipping arrangement to other countries in the Middle East. Map 3 shows an outline of the 
major old and new trade routes for agriculture and food commodities in the region. 

 

The changes in trading routes have posed significant challenges for neighbouring countries given the 
associated increases in transport costs and the need for increased infrastructural capacities in terms of 
port facilities, storage and other logistical requirements. To export through Haifa, for instance, the 
Jordanian traders have to address numerous logistical difficulties, including dealing with trucks of 
different volume carrying capacities compared with the regular size used in Jordan. The change in 
trade routes has mostly been accompanied by changes in destination markets, which meant the need 
for additional investment to meet quality requirements of the new markets. In addition, the change in 
trade routes raised the urgent need to strengthen border food quality and safety control in ports to 
which agricultural trade is diverting. 

 

 


Map 3. Effects of the Syria crisis on agricultural trade routes in the region 

 

 

Increased informal trade in food and agricultural commodities 

 

Informal trade (and smuggling) between Syria and its neighbouring countries increased in 2011 and 
2012, particularly for basic food and petroleum products. Traded food items included, among others, 
fruit, vegetables, bread and groceries. Livestock (including sheep and cattle) have been informally 
traded through the borders in Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon (see Section 3.1.5). Although Turkey has 
officially closed its land border with Syria to all trade (with the exception of humanitarian food 
supplies), traders have found ingenious ways of bypassing border controls, including the off-loading 
of goods onto Syrian registered trucks for their onward journeys. 

 

Overall, the disruptions in trade have had negative impacts on small-scale producers and workers 
along the supply chains of most agricultural commodities. The communities living close to the 
borders with Syria have been affected the most as a result of lost jobs and decline in farm businesses. 
In Turkey, for example, farmers from border areas have reported a more than 40 percent fall in farm-
gate prices for grapes, olives and pistachio nuts because Syrian refugees are returning to their farms, 
harvesting their trees, and returning to Turkey to sell their produce to processors/wholesalers at much 
lower prices. Lebanese returnees are also selling their animals at between one-half and two-thirds of 
market prices in order to pay for house rents, food and essential non-food items. In addition, the risks 
associated with food quality and safety and threats of transboundary animal and plant diseases and 
pests have increased as a result of the informal trade and the changing trade routes (see Section 3.3). 

 

3.1.4 Availability of agricultural inputs, services and labour 

 

Agricultural inputs and services 

 

The bulk of agricultural inputs (e.g. fertilizers, animal feed, pesticides and chemicals, agricultural 
machinery) are imported in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. Imports of agricultural inputs have been 
disrupted and costs of imports have increased in most of the countries. Imports of inputs such as 
animal feed in Jordan (which used to be imported through Syria) have been affected significantly, 
resulting in a negative impact on the livestock subsector. Animal feed prices in 2012 have increased 
by 22 percent for barley and 38 percent for bran compared with the averages of 2009/2010, mostly 


due to increased transportation cost as a result of the change in trading route from Tartous in Syria to 
the new ports of Al-Aqaba and Haifa. 

 

In the Bekaa Valley and Northern Lebanon, most agricultural inputs used to be imported at low prices 
from Syria, including veterinary services, pesticides, seeds, fertilizers, forage, medications for 
beekeeping, diesel for transportation and other consumer goods. Due to the conflict within Syria and 
the border insecurity situation, the flow of these agricultural inputs has been disrupted. This has 
resulted in significant shortages in areas like Akkar and Hermel Districts, forcing farmers to look for 
alternative sources of inputs at much higher costs. 

 

Veterinary services inside Syria (e.g. animal disease surveillance, vaccination programmes, 
quarantine facilities) collapsed early in 2012. While veterinary services in Turkey are able to manage 
the increased threat of TADs coming from Syria, those of Iraq and Lebanon and the border areas of 
Jordan are not able to cope. The risk of diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), peste des 
petits ruminants (PPR) and lumpy skin disease (LSD) breaking out in Syria and spreading across the 
region is heightened (see Section 3.3.2). There is a similar risk with crop diseases and pests, such as 
wheat rust and tomato leaf miner, with the collapse of plant protection services in Syria and weak 
sanitary and phytosanitary controls at border crossings (see Section 3.3.3). The lack of financial and 
technical resources provided by governments over the past decade for national agricultural research 
and extension services in support of smallholder farmers – especially those in remote border locations 
– already places this group of vulnerable people at a high risk of falling into the escalating „poverty 
trap.. 

 

Movement and availability of agricultural labour 

 

The Syria crisis has resulted in an inflow of a large number of refugees and migrant workers into 
neighbouring countries. On one hand, this has helped a few productive sectors such as construction 
and large-scale agriculture (with their lower salary demands), but on the other hand has created a 
displacement of traditional labour sources. While in urban areas, incoming labourers are concentrated 
in the services sector and have evidently not caused a large disruption (e.g. bakeries, restaurants, 
shop-keeping), refugees residing in rural areas are mostly competing for farming jobs at the expense 
of local labour. 

 

Olive picking is an example of agricultural activity now dominated by Syrian migrant labourers and 
refugees in the Syrian border areas of Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, given their relatively high skill 
(replacing those traditionally from Egypt, northern Turkey, etc.). The impact on Egyptian migrant 
workers in Jordan has not been examined; however, the potential for negative impacts is there – 
particularly given the increased desperation Egyptians may be experiencing due to the economic 
instability in their own country. Regarding Turkey, the impact of the influx of Syrian refugees is 
generally seen to be filling a labour gap that existed, whereby agricultural labour in these provinces 
prior to the crisis in Syria was sourced from other areas in Turkey. The impact on these labourers, and 
communities from where labour was sourced prior to the crisis, was not assessed. 

 

In Jordan and Lebanon, a large number of the people in the border host communities (e.g. in Al-
Ramtha and Hermel Districts) have either lost their jobs, or their incomes have been significantly 
reduced as they were mostly related to trading with Syria. Most are unable to find alternative jobs to 
compensate for their loss of income. 

 

3.1.5 Food access and availability 

 

The continued civil unrest in Syria has raised serious concern over the state of food security in the 
neighbouring countries of Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon and the Middle East Region as a whole, 
particularly among the vulnerable communities of border areas including those hosting refugees. The 
increased stress on resources, water and food, with a decline in income and economic activity is 
adding tremendous strain on neighbouring countries at the national, local and household levels. 

 

 


Food availability 

 

The crisis in Syria is posing a significant challenge to food availability in neighbouring countries at 
the national, local and household levels. The crisis is affecting food availability in neighbouring 
countries through: (i) the negative effect on local food productive capacities, mostly owing to the 
security situation in border areas; (ii) the increased demand for food as a result of the growing influx 
of refugees and returnees from Syria and increased fiscal burden to maintain food subsidies; and 
(iii) the considerable fall in imports of food products from Syria. 

 

Apart from Turkey, Syria.s neighbouring countries import together over 50 percent of their food 
needs. The crisis in Syria has led to a significant drop in food production in the country and is 
negatively affecting food production in the rest of the region – raising the need for food imports and 
thus increasing the exposure of these countries to shocks in world food supplies and prices. Estimates 
of cereal production for the 2012/2013 season showed significant declines in Iraq, Syria and Turkey 
(of 15.9 percent, 25.2 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively). This is severely affecting the availability 
of cereals in the markets, pushing governments in these countries to increase imports and stock 
options. This puts a strain on stocks and local prices in these countries as they are trying to cope with 
fiscal strains of refugees and returnees. In Lebanon, estimates point to a 20 percent increase in total 
cereal production in 2012 above the previous year, which was affected by dry weather conditions. 
This increase in production will cater marginally to the increased demand due to the Syria crisis, as 
domestic cereal production covers on average about 17 percent of consumption needs and the country 
depends heavily on imports. 

 

The 2012 winter crop harvest in Egypt has concluded, and the latest estimates indicate an above-
average production of 8.7 million tonnes of wheat – exceeding last year.s already high harvest by an 
additional 4 percent. The increase in wheat production was attributed to availability of improved 
varieties, favourable weather conditions and increased government procurement prices. The current 
stock of wheat – estimated at about 5 million tonnes, according to the Ministry of Supply and Internal 
Trade – covers requirements for a maximum of five to six months. Overall, cereal imports are 
expected to rise for Syria and its neighbouring countries by over 5 million tonnes in 2013, constituting 
an increase of about 25 percent of the import levels of 2009/2010. 

 

Food production in certain areas in neighbouring countries has been affected as a result of the border 
insecurity and conflicts. This was particularly evident in several border areas of Akkar and Bekaa-
Hermel Districts in Lebanon, and in Gaziantep, Kilis and Sanliurfa Provinces in Turkey, where the 
insecurity prevailing in most border areas with Syria prevented many farmers from accessing their 
farmland during important stages of crop development and harvest. 

 

The inflow of refugees and returnees has placed pressure on available food supplies in neighbouring 
countries. The effect was particularly evident in the cases of Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon, where 
estimates suggest that Syrian refugees represent about 4, 5 and 10 percent of the total population, 
respectively. This places considerable pressure on food supply capacities in these countries in terms of 
imports, storage, processing and distribution systems, as well as on government ability to maintain 
subsidies for flour, bread and animal feed. The food import bills of these countries – which are 
already heavily dependent on imports of basic food commodities particularly cereals and sugar – will 
have to increase by a significant margin to cope with the growing demand. There is also pressure on 
food storage capacities and strategic reserves. It was estimated that the current six-month strategic 
food reserves in Jordan (i.e. mostly wheat) will run out over the next four months if the inflow of 
refugees continues at its current rate. 

 

The new situation also places significant burden on some governments. ability to maintain their 
current consumer subsidy schemes, including for food and energy. In Jordan, the Government is 
already spending around 1 percent of GDP on food subsidies, and about 2.4 percent on fuel subsidies 
(2011 figures). Food availability in Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq has also been affected by the significant 
drop (i.e. of more than 50 percent) of food imports from Syria as a result of the crisis. 

 

 


Loss of incomes along food chains 

 

The closure of the borders and the decreased ability of producers to export their products to Syrian 
markets as well as to other markets transiting through Syria (e.g. Turkey, GCC and Eastern Europe) 
have resulted in a loss of income among farming communities and many of the people working along 
the food and agriculture commodity chains. Increased competition between refugee workers and local 
workers also resulted in reduced household incomes in host communities. Host communities in border 
areas of Jordan and Lebanon have been hit hardest in terms of income losses due to the deterioration 
in their farming and trading businesses and job losses. Host communities in Ramtha (Jordan) and 
Akkar and Hermel (Lebanon) are already among the poorest segments of these countries; their main 
occupation is farming, as well as other activities linked to border trading. 

 

Trade diversion to other markets and the change in trading routes (from border crossing points with 
Syria to other ports within neighbouring countries) have cost many jobs in the border towns and 
villages of Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon, and in the road transport industry and its service providers. 

 

Border insecurity has also led to the displacement of a large number of people within some of the 
neighbouring countries. For example, in Lebanon and Turkey, many farmers at the border areas could 
not continue their farming activities and lost some of their livestock and farm assets. 

 

The illegal trade of animals in the border areas has also reduced the price of live animals. For 
example, a dairy cow is now being sold for one-third of its normal price in Lebanon. The same trend 
is reported in Jordan, where Syrian Awassi sheep and Shami goats are being sold at about half of the 
usual market price. Farmers on the Turkish-Syrian border have also complained about the progressive 
reduction in price for their animals on the market, although they could not associate this directly with 
the Syria crisis. In conclusion, farmers and pastoralists of Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon are abandoning 
their livestock farming business as they are unable to cope with the increasing feed price and 
decreasing price of their animals and some animal products. Annex 3 provides more country-specific 
information on changes in the prices of animal feed, livestock and animal products. 

 

Increased cost of food 

 

Price inflation, resulting from increased demand for basic food and services, has led to increased food 
costs. While the prices of some food products have decreased, particularly those items that could not 
be exported, overall food prices have been higher than before the crisis. Between 2011 and 2012, food 
prices increased by about 8 percent in Iraq, 5 percent in Jordan and 10 percent in Lebanon. In Jordan, 
the increase in food prices is particularly high for meat (14 percent), dairy products (19 percent), 
sugar (12 percent) and eggs (30 percent). The hosting of refugees has also been a big burden for many 
families in neighbouring countries, particularly in districts bordering Syria such as Al-Ramtha and 
Irbid in Jordan, and Akkar and Bekaa in Lebanon. The refugee recipient areas are already categorized 
among the poorest in these countries. In some areas, hosting communities are now receiving refugees 
of more than seven people per household. 

 

The good road network between Lebanon, Jordan and Syria and the strong family links that exist 
across borders have made inhabitants of the border towns in Jordan and Lebanon dependent on Syria 
as a major source of imported food products and other groceries. These food items used to be obtained 
at much lower prices compared with domestic food supply sources within these countries. The 
disruption of cross-border transportation of food products and commodities has put a higher pressure 
on the incomes of these families and has forced a change in their dietary consumption. 

 

The increased demand for poultry products in Jordan and a reduced supply have tripled the price of 
eggs. This may also be linked to the presence of the high number of Syrian refugees in the country. 
The smuggling of cheaper eggs to neighbouring countries from Syria has been a long-known fact 
(particularly to Iraq and Lebanon); this, however, has now dried up due to the destruction of major 
poultry farms in Homs and rural Damascus. Lebanon used to import white cheese from Syria, but now 
the country has resorted to buying more expensive white cheese from Egypt and European Union 
suppliers. 


3.2 Needs of refugees, returnees and host communities (agriculture sector) 

 

3.2.1 Overall socio-economic situation of affected areas 

 

With the exception of Egypt and KRG of Iraq, refugees and returnees are located in some of the 
poorest areas („poverty pockets.) of countries neighbouring Syria – i.e. parts of northwestern Iraq, 
northern Jordan, northern and eastern Lebanon, and southeastern Turkey. 

 

Priority needs for refugees throughout the five hosting countries of Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and 
Turkey are mostly related to security, affordable and decent accommodation, and access to more 
stable income sources to cover livelihood and household needs. Insecurity is higher among non-
registered refugees, who are the most vulnerable to being exploited by employers and rely on host 
communities to assist them with their basic needs of food and shelter. 

 

Host communities in these countries may both benefit and suffer from the availability of Syrians as 
cheaper labour, as well as the cheaper agricultural products coming with those who cross from Syria. 
Households that are poor and likely to be strongly impacted by the changes to their costs and incomes 
need to be targeted for assistance to ensure they are able to increase their resilience to the continuing 
changes resulting from the crisis. Overall, high levels of unemployment, increasing costs in Jordan, as 
well as instability in Lebanon and Egypt underlay the impacts of the crisis on affected communities. 

 

Broadly, communities affected (i.e. both positively and negatively) by the Syria crisis can be grouped 
into the below categories, while a number of communities fall into more than one group: 

 

i. Communities hosting Syrian refugees and returnees: affected by increasing rents, increased 
pressure on household resources and access to food, increased competition for, and availability 
of, labour, etc. 
ii. Communities neighbouring refugee camps: affected mostly by the availability of surplus 
labour and competition with local labour, possible changes in food prices and shortages in 
energy and other services as a result of the growing demand from the camp, possible market 
opportunities for local farm produce (e.g. Jordan and Turkey), and possible loss of agricultural 
land (e.g. Turkey)12. 
iii. Communities in close proximity to the border and affected by violence and insecurity: 
directly affected by the security situation and border conflict, cannot access their farmlands or 
move freely and may need to relocate internally (e.g. Lebanon and Turkey). 
iv. Communities where livelihoods are highly engaged and interacting with communities in Syria: 
including traders, seasonal labourers, cross-border relatives or farmers (e.g. Iraq, Jordan, 
Lebanon and Turkey) who used to obtain their subsidized agricultural inputs and services from 
Syria and now face loss of income and degraded livelihoods as a result of higher input costs 
and loss of markets for their products, increased competition and availability of labour, etc. 


12 While refugee camps have been built on public land, there are cases where this land was cultivated. 

 

What is common in all countries is that coping strategies of host communities, refugees and returnees 
in all border areas are being seriously eroded as time passes, food prices are unstable and rental prices 
increase drastically. 

 

3.2.2 Egypt 

 

Accommodation is an important priority need of Syrian refugees living in Egypt, as well as income 
and livelihood support in order to cope with the high costs of living in Egypt. 

- Housing. Syrians are not located in areas of cities where other refugee nationalities and poorer 
Egyptian populations are located; rather, they view staying away from areas high in crime and 
noise as important for the safety of their families. 



- Income. In the initial months following arrival (three to five months), Syrian refugees are seeking 
employment in their particular fields of expertise. As time passes and their financial resources 
diminish, they lower their expectations. However, refugees have recognized that they live on a 
day-by-day basis and are not planning for longer periods of time – but instead are focusing on a 
return to Syria. Some refugees, who arrived over a year ago and kept some resources, have 
established small businesses (e.g. milk processing, food outlets and restaurants) and tend to 
employ Syrian refugees. This was reported not to create particular tension with Egyptian 
communities as most of the jobs offered are of low interest to them. A number of refugees 
indicated interest in starting some food processing activities (e.g. cottage industries, fruit 
processing and home-based cooking), but lack the initial capital required for such investments. 


 

While the majority of Syrians have to rent apartments in cities, some Egyptians have provided free or 
cheap accommodation and sometimes cover food expenditures, at least for short periods of time. 
There have not been any incidents reported in Egypt between Egyptians and Syrian refugee 
populations and the atmosphere has been one of solidarity. Sensitivity to the ongoing instability in 
Egypt and the problems facing Egypt.s urban poor should be considered in any future response plan 
for Syrian refugees. Increasing opportunities to generate income, enhance livelihoods and increase 
access to nutritious and sufficient food for Egypt.s urban poor is also an urgent need. 

 

Finally, refugee populations from other nationalities are not receiving the same benefits as Syrian 
refugees from the Government of Egypt or UN agencies, and are generally aware of this fact. As 
services increase and time passes, tensions could possibly arise between these communities (or 
increasing pressure on already overstretched organizations providing services to refugees). 

 

3.2.3 Iraq 

 

Income-generation activity to pay for food and rent is the most important priority for Syrian refugees 
in Iraq, particularly for the large numbers living outside of camps. High costs of living in the Kurdish 
Region mean that Syrian refugees and Iraqi returnees may look for employment throughout Iraq, and 
their mobility rates are high. Many are not accessing services available for registered refugees due to 
the high cost of accessing registration locations and, as this also allows access for permits to reside in 
Iraq, these refugees are at risk of being exploited by employers. 

 

In the Kurdish Region in particular, the Government, local authorities and communities are in the 
rebuilding phase of many sectors and industries. The economy is growing quickly, but it is not yet 
well-developed. Those involved in the agriculture sector are generally reported to be an aging 
population, calling for enhanced agricultural capacity among younger generations. Food production 
and processing need to be developed in order to both increase the economic importance of agriculture 
and to enhance the food security situation of the region. Income generation from increased 
agricultural productivity (through investment in mechanization, irrigation, etc.) and agro-industries 
(e.g. input supply, food processing and animal feed) needs to be enhanced by targeting those who are 
poorer and more vulnerable, thus making farming and farm business more attractive to youth and 
improving the overall quality and stability of this type of livelihood. 

 

3.2.4 Jordan 

 

Despite the fact that refugees inside the Zaatari Refugee Camp may have agricultural skills, they 
cannot access land nor develop home gardening within the camp due to the limited space. Their 
livelihood options inside the camp are therefore limited to the trade of items needed in the camp, as 
well as possible small-scale food processing. Those with identity cards or proper documents can apply 
to leave the camp, but those without must either remain in the camp or find alternative, unofficial 
methods for leaving. Nutrition and availability of a number of higher protein food items are of 
concern to those residing in the camp, and opportunities to address nutrition, access to protein, and 
income-generating activities in the camp are needed. 

 

As mentioned previously, Syrian refugees outside the camp reside in both urban and rural areas. 
Refugees may actually be former migrant agricultural workers, living in rural farming areas including 
the Jordan Valley, where they used to come and work seasonally for large- and medium-scale 


Jordanian farmers. The recent large influx of refugees has created increasing competition for unskilled 
work, resulting in wages dropping as low as JD 150 for 30 days of work. Those outside of the camps 
are the most severely exposed to depleted resources and lack of access to livelihoods, impacting their 
possibilities to rent shelter and to access food and services. As Jordan.s labour laws specifically 
exclude workers in domestic service, small family-owned businesses and agriculture, refugees and 
migrant workers are often at the mercy of their employers and cannot legally exercise or defend their 
fundamental rights. They are not covered by minimum wage regulations or by social protections, such 
as health, vacation, sick leave and pension benefits. The lack of a non-discriminatory, adequate legal 
process for documentation keeps many such workers out of the formal and regulated economy, both 
depriving them of their basic rights and setting them against groups of other workers who do not 
suffer such discrimination. Access to safe and decent work is needed by Syrian non-camp refugee 
populations, as well as controlled rents and affordable and nutritious food. Information on how to 
access services provided to registered refugees would also be useful. 

 

Jordanians living in the same communities as non-camp refugee populations are facing, along with 
those refugees, a sharp increase in rent prices and significantly lower labour wages (agricultural and 
other). This is in combination with an already existing trend of increasing food prices. Jordanians who 
were already living on or below the poverty line (i.e. less than JD 68 per person per month) will feel 
the impact of these combined factors the most. Access to income-generating activities as well as 
improving access to affordable food is a priority need for Jordanians impacted by the Syria crisis. 

 

There have been emerging reports of tensions between Jordanian and Syrian refugee populations, 
particularly in Mafraq Governorate where poverty rates were higher than in other areas. The main 
reasons for this are the perceived aforementioned impacts. 

 

3.2.5 Lebanon 

 

In Akkar District, a higher proportion of Syrian families are being hosted by Lebanese households, 
depleting much-needed resources. In the Bekaa Valley, the majority of Syrian households are renting 
accommodation. The influx of Syrians has impacted the casual labour market, causing up to a 
60 percent reduction in daily wages. Additionally, the insecurity of border areas has interrupted the 
import of Syrian commodities, which are cheaper than their Lebanese equivalents. The insecurity has 
also interrupted trade-related livelihoods, which is particularly significant for the economies of border 
communities. 

 

Host and border communities are impacted by the crisis itself in terms of either the reduction of 
income generation owing to increased costs, and/or the inability to conduct business as usual due to 
the need for high interactions with Syria. Host families in the north of Lebanon have been supporting 
refugees for over a year and are facing increasing difficulties in coping with the situation. In order to 
appreciate the current burden of Syrian refugees on Lebanese populations, particularly in Akkar and 
Bekaa, it is important to understand the economic reality of farmers in these provinces. The Syrian 
smuggling of crops that officially remained subject to Lebanese import taxes has been rampant and 
penalizing Lebanese farmers for years. Furthermore, the vast majority of farmers have little or no 
access to capital. The high operation costs of small loans and the inability of most small-scale farmers 
to provide collateral have long dissuaded the country's commercial banks from lending to the 
agriculture sector. On the other side of the border, the Syrian Government heavily subsidized the costs 
of agricultural inputs and created a favourable and enabling environment for Syrian farmers. A limited 
number of Lebanese farmers close to the border and particularly in northern areas have benefited from 
subsidized Syrian inputs through smuggling activities between the two countries, which are no longer 
available. 

 

Prior to the crisis in Syria, respondents of an IOM assessment in the north of Lebanon identified 
support to agriculture as well as small-scale food processing at household level as a priority need for 
the improvement of livelihoods and well-being. 

 

 


3.2.6 Turkey 

 

Syrian refugees living inside Turkish refugee camps appear, from all assessments, to have access to 
good services and facilities. Opportunities exist for Syrians to leave the camps for short periods of 
time, and they have reportedly taken on some agricultural labour. Inside the camps, trade and some 
very basic forms of urban gardening exist, which people take part in more to occupy their time than to 
generate income or produce food; however, these activities are valued by those engaged. Refugees 
outside of the camp also engage in casual work, including agricultural labour. Syrian workers are 
often paid half of the daily wage required by Turkish workers for the same task. Some Syrians are 
staying with host families, but the majority are renting. The influx in some communities results in 
increases of up to 30 percent of the population; the impacts on host communities and on Syrians 
themselves are significant in terms of food prices, rent prices and competition for labour. 

 

In some of the border areas, Syrians are filling a need for labour that was previously filled by 
labourers sourced from other provinces. The impact on local communities is felt negatively in terms 
of the wage rate for existing local Turkish labourers, and positively for farmers who have access to 
this less costly source of labour. Farmers are also impacted by the availability of Syrian products, 
which are brought to the Turkish market by those fleeing Syria and sold at cheaper prices. This is 
forcing Turkish farmers and livestock keepers to sell their products at prices that ultimately reduce 
their profit margins and household income. Additionally, the closure of borders has interrupted the 
trade of commodities, although the informal trade of these is flourishing; the impact of those engaging 
in such trade (in terms of change in profits and costs) must still be clearly ascertained. Most rural 
communities in the border areas with Syria comprise small-scale farms, with less than 1.5 hectares of 
land, operating agricultural activities on a family basis, occasionally employing casual labour for the 
harvesting of olives and grapes, for example. 

 

 

3.3 Transboundary animal and crop diseases and pests, and environmental threats 

 

3.3.1 Impact of the Syria crisis on animal health in neighbouring countries 

 

This section provides a regional overview of the impact of the Syria crisis on animal health in 
neighbouring countries. More details of a country-specific nature are provided in Annex 3. 

 

The first, and most important, impact is the increased uncontrolled movement of livestock across 
borders. This is particularly important because Syrian livestock have not been vaccinated against 
TADs and zoonoses for at least 6 to 12 months owing to the collapse of Syria.s field veterinary 
services. Syrian refugees (and Lebanese returnees) have brought unvaccinated sheep, goats and cattle 
to almost all countries sharing borders with Syria. This threatens the health of livestock, animal 
disease control programmes, grasslands and rangelands, and the health of people of those countries. It 
should be noted that only Turkey has efficient border controls for livestock movements through the 
slaughtering of all non-registered animals. There is clear evidence that unvaccinated live animals are 
being imported or have crossed illegally into Jordan and Lebanon, with minimum or zero quarantine, 
for sale on the open market (e.g. 300 000 goats were illegally imported from Syria to Jordan in 2012). 

 

The most serious impact of greater uncontrolled movements of livestock is the significant increase in 
the threat of TADs and zoonoses. Animal diseases that are reported and generally monitored and 
controlled in the region include FMD, PPR, bluetongue, brucellosis, HPAI, LSD, glanders, bovine 
tuberculosis, rabies and cutaneous leishmaniasis. It is important to note that FMD, PPR, bluetongue, 
brucellosis and LSD have all been unofficially reported in the Syrian border areas of Iraq, Jordan 
and Lebanon. Moreover, PPR, bovine tuberculosis and rabies have been officially reported in 
captured and slaughtered Syrian animals in Turkey. WHO has also reported tuberculosis and 
leishmaniasis in Jordan (including the Zaatari Refugee Camp) and Lebanon as an important health 
concern in the region. 

 

Although not a country bordering Syria, Egypt has its own serious livestock and poultry disease problems. 
Repeated incursions of new strains of FMD viruses and ongoing HPAI outbreaks are the biggest hurdles 
facing the livestock and poultry subsectors. Egypt also reported cases of PPR in 2012, and LSD has been 


endemic for a number of years. Egyptian veterinary authorities are also concerned about the spread of 
LSD, which is linked to dairy cows smuggled through tunnels linking the Gaza Strip to Sinai. 

 

Only Turkey can claim to possess an animal health system that can effectively manage the threat of 
TADs spreading from neighbouring countries such as Syria. This is due to the fact that the country 
has received considerable financial and technical support from the European Union to control TADs 
and prevent them from spreading to Turkey.s western borders with Europe. 

 

Like Turkey, all animals in Jordan are registered and vaccinated regularly – a requirement for 
farmers to benefit from subsidized animal feed for their sheep and goats. However, Jordan does not 
undertake any TAD surveillance and reporting, and its nearest quarantine facility is 35 km from the 
Syrian border, which does not comply with minimum international biosecurity standards. 

 

Veterinary services in Iraq and Lebanon are weak, with no surveillance and reporting of TADs, 
animal quarantine facilities nor registered animal vaccination programmes. Lebanon has opened 
vacancies and has been recruiting 200 additional veterinary surgeons since last year, but this is too 
late for this present threat of TADs. 

 

As mentioned above, Egypt is a special case where FAO is already assisting the Ministry of 
Agriculture to control TADs through a multi-donor funded project, which has been running since 
2005 at a total cost of USD 16.7 million (see Annex 1.1). 

 

FAO.s advice to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon to reinforce their countries. quarantine facilities and 
mobilize vaccination campaigns against major TADs across its border areas with Syria has been well 
received by the respective government authorities. Active animal disease surveillance and reporting 
systems and effective quarantine infrastructure in high-risk border areas are clearly not in place at 
present. FMD, PPR and LSD are the diseases most feared by the veterinary authorities of those 
countries. The establishment of effective TAD surveillance systems for major threats such as FMD 
(including new strains), PPR and LSD is therefore urgently required before the high-risk months of 
April and November. 

 

A second significant impact of the Syria crisis on animal and human health is the safety and quality of 
animal feeds and animal source foods. Unlawful trade of unsafe foods and animal feeds is being 
practiced owing to the disruption of regulatory systems, border inspection posts and law enforcements 
in Syria (and is possibly the case in neighbouring countries due to insecurity in border areas). For 
example, inspection of products of animal origin and regulatory systems failed to identify chicken 
meat that had been imported for processing for other uses, ending up in the Zaatari Refugee Camp and 
sold as fresh meat for human consumption. There is a danger that unsafe animal feeds, stored in bad 
storage facilities or stranded in unrefrigerated trucks along insecure trade routes, may end up in the 
hands of desperate smallholder farmers and herders who are impacted by the current high price of 
animal feed. 

 

3.3.2 Threat of transboundary crop diseases and pests 

 

Like TADs, there is also a threat of transboundary crop diseases and pests breaking out in Syria and 
spreading across the region. Crop protection and phytosanitary inspection services collapsed in Syria 
during 2012 – just like their veterinary services. There has been increasing informal trade (smuggling) 
of food and agricultural commodities across borders with Syria in Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon following 
the crisis in Syria. There have also been significant changes in agricultural trading routes throughout 
the region. All of these developments have increased the risk of trading food of substandard quality 
and the threat of transboundary plant diseases and pests accompanying the moving commodities – 
given the weak food safety and phytosanitary inspection systems in these countries, particularly at 
existing border crossings and especially at new border crossings. 

 

The plant protection affairs of Turkey (including internal and external plant quarantine, control of 
harmful organisms, sampling procedure and plant quarantine inspection regulation) are adequate and 
operational with no major deficiencies – a model for other countries in the Near East Region to 
follow. The informal importation and smuggling of Syrian plant materials and food products do not 


pose a significant sanitary and phytosanitary threat, although economic implications have been 
documented elsewhere in this report. 

 

Three crop fungi and pests of note are wheat rust, tomato leaf miner and fruit flies – all of which can 
severely damage important crops in the region. 

 

Wheat rust 

 

Wheat rust diseases are among the major constraints to wheat production in the Near East. Rust 
diseases are airborne and respect no boundaries. They can spread over borders and cause significant 
yield losses across large areas. Wheat rust diseases, being among the major transboundary plant pests 
and diseases, cause significant losses to farmers, and pose a major threat to food security. Climate 
change – in terms of rising temperatures, and the timing and increasing variability of rainfall – is 
contributing to the spread and severity of rust diseases. Emerging races of rust are showing 
adaptations to extreme temperatures not seen before. For example, virulent Stem rust variant Ug99 
(identified in Uganda in 1999) has been progressing out of East Africa via airborne spores. In early 
2007, Ug99 was detected in the Near East Region. Similarly, yellow rust (also known as stripe rust) 
has in recent years become more of an immediate threat, with the emergence of new, highly-
aggressive strains that are able to knock out genetic resistance in many of the most popular varieties 
of wheat. 

 
To combat the problem of wheat rusts, farmers in the Near East Region need to adopt new varieties of 
wheat that have durable resistance to both stem and stripe rust. Unfortunately, lack of local capacity 
and ability of national programmes to rapidly multiply seeds and deliver them to seed markets are 
bottlenecks to getting resistant varieties into the field in time to protect local harvests. In the case of 
Syria, the development of new varieties was conducted by ICARDA in Aleppo, but the conflict has 
totally disrupted research and development work there. Some research activities and seed 
multiplication works are being conducted in satellite sites (e.g. Terbol, Lebanon). FAO has identified 
Egypt, Syria and Turkey as three of nine countries most at risk of new virulent races of wheat rust. 
Uncontrolled movement of wheat grain between Syria and neighbouring countries is therefore a major 
and significant biosecurity risk that requires immediate attention. Regional risk-based inspection 
systems are necessary in order to improve biosecurity. 

 

Tomato leaf miner (Tuta Absoluta) 

 

Tomato borer, with its high reproductive capacity, is deemed one of the most serious and destructive 
pests of tomato crops. It also attacks plants of the Solanaceae family, such as potato, eggplant, pepper, 
tobacco and solanaceous weeds, as well as common beans. Tomato is one of the most economically 
important crops in the Near East Region (particularly in Jordan) and is the main host of the pest. 

 

The small brownish moth was first introduced from South America into Spain in 2006, and later 
spread into all countries of the Mediterranean Basin and the Near East. The tomato borer has bred 
quickly and moved easily across borders. Some countries have been able to minimize the insect.s 
ability to reproduce and limit its potential to spread and damage crops. In January 2013, FAO 
launched a small regional project to cover the most affected countries in the region, namely Egypt, 
Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen (see Annex 1.6). FAO.s objective is to replicate this 
successful intervention as the pest makes its way east and south-eastwards. However, the project does 
not foresee general inspection procedures for clearing commercial and non-commercial importation of 
fruits and vegetables in critical areas such as the Syrian borders. 

 

Fruit flies 

 

The last major outbreak of fruit flies was the peach fruit fly across the Near East and North Africa 
Regions in mid-2000. An FAO regional programme assisted the Ministries of Agriculture of Egypt, 
Iran, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen to eliminate peach fruit fly from specific areas through the 
identification and strengthening of phytosanitary measures implemented in order to prevent the 
introduction and spread of the pest to the non-infested areas. 

 


3.3.3 Environmental threats 

 

Traditional livestock movements across the Near East Region in the form of transhumance are very 
common – particularly across the Badia rangelands of southern Syria, northwestern Iraq and 
northeastern Jordan. The Badia rangelands are fragile semi-desert steppes, characterized by a sparse 
vegetation cover (of nutritious species palatable for sheep and goats). The continued insecurity in 
Syria has meant that the cross-border movement of Bedouin herders from winter grazing in Syria to 
summer grazing in Iraq and Jordan has been severely disrupted. The protracted crisis has resulted in 
Bedouin herders abandoning their Syrian pastures and staying all-year round on the rangelands of 
northwestern Iraq and northeastern Jordan. The consequences of this include the invasion of 
unpalatable species (weeds and scrub) in the Syrian pastures and overgrazing, and land degradation 
(leading to potential desertification) of the Badia rangelands of Iraq and Jordan. There is already 
evidence of overgrazing in northeastern Jordan as herders seek alternative animal feed sources, 
especially in winter months. 

 

Over the past two decades, Jordanian farmers have been irrigating parts of the Badia rangelands using 
underground water sources (from local aquifers) to grow fruit and vegetables (especially tomato, 
watermelon and potato), wheat, fruit trees and animal fodder. The Government of Jordan is now very 
concerned that recent boreholes sunk for water supplies at the Zaatari Refugee Camp will deplete, if 
not exhaust, the local aquifer used by rural communities and large-sale irrigated farmers in that area. 
The Government is further concerned that the inadequate waste disposal systems found at the Zaatari 
Camp will also lead to pollution of local water supplies. 

 

3.4 National and international responses to the Syria crisis 

 

3.4.1 Governments of neighbouring countries to Syria 

 

On the whole, responses from the Governments of Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey have 
been welcoming in terms of keeping borders open and providing social services to Syrian refugees. 
Registered Syrians, staying in refugee camps and with host communities, are generally permitted to 
access public health and education services of those countries. 

 

The Government of Egypt grants Syrian refugees a visa-free entry, followed by a renewable three-
month residency, and access to public schools and hospitals without bearing additional costs. There 
has not been a priority as of yet to address the impacts and needs of host communities related to this 
crisis. Additionally, the Government has requested WFP to distribute food vouchers to registered 
Syrian refugees for use in local supermarkets. 

 

The Government of Jordan, in collaboration with international agencies, is working to plan and 
manage the Zaatari and a second new refugee camp, as well as to provide access to services among 
non-camp populations, and to address the growing number of people crossing the border. The 
Government has indicated that they will close the border if the numbers become too great for the 
camps and host communities to accommodate. Currently, Palestinian refugees without sufficient 
Syrian documentation are refused entry. In addition, the Government is increasingly aware of the 
strain and impact on host communities and is attempting to target poor and vulnerable populations for 
safety-net and recovery programmes and projects in response to this issue. 

 

The Government of Lebanon has an open border policy and is actively working with international 
agencies to address the needs of both the Syrian refugees and their host communities, but not 
Lebanese returnees. Lebanon has not yet established any camps for the refugees due to a number of 
sensitivities and challenges in the border areas. In December 2012, the Government set up a 
ministerial committee to produce a plan, which sets out areas of government engagement totalling 
USD 178 million. 

 

The Government of Turkey has established 17 camps for Syrian refugees – which provide medical 
and educational services and three meals per day – and continues to construct new ones. By mid-
February 2013, the Government had reportedly spent over USD 600 million on services addressing 


the crisis in Syria (not including salaries, expenses, etc.). The Disaster and Emergency Management 
Presidency of Turkey (AFAD), in collaboration with the Turkish Red Crescent, are actively engaged 
in the management of the camps, as well as in providing access to medical services for non-camp 
registered populations. 

 

In Zaatari Camp, the Government of Jordan has permitted Syrian refugees to operate small make-shift 
shops with goods ranging from fruit, vegetables and meat products, to clothes, heaters and televisions 
– all supplied by Jordanian wholesalers from Amman and other cities. Like the camps in Iraq and 
Turkey, there is insufficient space for refugees to operate kitchen gardens to grow vegetables and rear 
chickens. However, there is evidence from Turkish camps that refugees are growing vegetables and 
herbs in small containers around, or hanging from, their tents and containerized housing units. This is 
despite AFAD stating that there is no need for such food production, given the “three meals per day” 
policy and the risk of unhygienic conditions developing within the camps. Contrary to this directive, 
the Provincial Government of Kilis has recently announced that all new Syrian refugee camps in its 
province will include areas designated for refugees to grow fruits, vegetables, herbs, etc. – more for 
reasons of occupational therapy than for the provision of added nutrients and vitamins to diets and 
small amounts of supplementary income generated from the sale of produce. 

 

3.4.2 United Nations agencies 

 

The UN reports that the dramatic increase in the number of refugees from Syria across the region in 
2012 and early 2013 continues to require a large-scale response to address the needs of both refugees 
already present in host countries and new arrivals who continue to pour into Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq 
and Turkey at a rate of thousands per day. When the first Syrian Regional Response Plan (RRP) was 
published in March 2012 (and subsequently revised twice, in June and September 2012), it initially 
planned for some 96 500 refugees to receive assistance over a period of six months. As part of the 
second revision of RRP, UN agencies appealed for a total of USD 487.9 million to cover needs up to 
the end of 2012. As of 15 November 2012, 51 percent of this amount had been funded. 

 

In December 2012, UN agencies prepared a third revision (“RRP-IV”), setting the strategic objectives 
and activities for the first six months of 2013. At that time, the RRP anticipated that the number of 
refugees would reach 1.1 million by June 2013. However, by March 2013, the number of Syrian 
refugees had already reached 1 million and continues to grow. For the first time, this planning figure 
covers refugees in Egypt, whose numbers have grown significantly over the past year. At a time of 
social, political and economic upheaval in many of the host countries, further compounded by the 
conflict in Syria, RRP-IV aims to provide lifesaving assistance to refugees, while ensuring that the cost 
of their welcome is not borne by the countries of asylum alone, or by the many local communities and 
their vulnerable populations which have already shown considerable generosity despite their limited 
means. 

 

The second Regional Strategic Objective of RRP-IV confirms that the priority areas of intervention 
will continue to include: the provision of food assistance, non-food items and/or financial assistance; 
access to healthcare and education; and quick impact projects in host communities that are struggling 
to cope with the additional strain on their infrastructure. However, there was no consideration for the 
increasing threat of transboundary animal and crop diseases and pests emerging from Syria, the 
deteriorating condition of food traded across official and unofficial border crossings, increasing 
malnutrition among farm families of host communities, and the medium-term needs of rural host 
communities to recover their food production and income-generating functions following the shock of 
the Syria crisis in the border areas of Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey and the peri-urban areas of 
Egypt (see Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3). 

 

As part of the Seventh Syria Humanitarian Forum on 19 February 2013, the United Nations Under-
Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator chaired a roundtable 
discussion of UN agencies based in Amman, Jordan. The meeting concluded that there are strong 
needs for: (i) follow-up with all the countries (especially from the Gulf States) having made pledges 
during the donor conference in Kuwait (see Section 3.4.3) on how funds will be channeled and 
priorities defined; (ii) linking emergency response to medium-term recovery and long-term 
rehabilitation and development – agriculture was mentioned as a key sector in this domain; 


(iii) developing strong contingency plans – as the end of the crisis is uncertain: (iv) increasing UN 
assistance to refugees, and even more so to host communities – an opinion expressed by every agency 
participating in the roundtable discussions. 

 

The United Nations Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief 
Coordinator also expressed a strong interest in FAO.s regional assessment to assess the impact of the 
Syria crisis on the agriculture sector of host countries/communities and requested an early release of 
its findings and recommendations. To conclude, it is clear that there is now a strong shift towards 
providing additional support to host families in the Syria border areas of Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and 
Turkey (most of which are from poor farming communities) and in Egypt. It is anticipated that RRP-
V, which is currently under preparation, will address the „agricultural dimension. of early recovery 
following this Humanitarian Forum and FAO.s assessment and response plan. 

 

UN agencies in Lebanon have recently created a “Task Force to Support Lebanese Communities 
Affected by the Syrian Crisis” – co-led by UNDP and UNHCR. The Task Force has developed a 
Strategic Framework for Response comprising 72 project proposals targeted at host communities to 
Syrian refugees in Lebanon, with a total funding request of some USD 50 million over two years 
(with many small projects of six months or less). Most of the project proposals were urban-based; the 
three projects targeted at farmers (at a total cost estimate of USD 1.25 million) cover activities such as 
the training of farmers in cooperative management and organic farming, as well we improving 
livelihoods through quick-impact interventions such as equipping cooperatives with generators and 
tools, and supporting fishers through the rehabilitation and improvement of fish processing and selling 
facilities. It should be noted that the worst affected and most vulnerable and impoverished Lebanese 
farming families hosting Syrian refugees in the border areas do not belong to cooperatives. 

 

3.4.3 Development partners 

 

On 30 January 2013, the Government of Kuwait hosted a donor conference, which was chaired by the 
Secretary-General of the United Nations, to assist civilians affected by the ongoing crisis for the first 
half of 2013, including those taking refuge beyond the Syrian borders. Donor countries and 
international organizations pledged more than USD 1.5 billion – i.e. USD 1 billion for Syrian 
neighbours hosting refugees and USD 500 million to fund humanitarian work for Syrians afflicted by 
the crisis inside their country, in support of RRP-IV and the Syrian Humanitarian Response Plan, 
respectively. 

 

Nearly two-thirds of the total funds pledged by donors were by the Gulf countries, but it was unclear 
how these funds would be channelled. To date, much of the humanitarian assistance funded by these 
States prior to the donor conference has been provided bilaterally outside of the two UN Response 
Plans. However, they stated that future funds “will be delivered in assistance to countries helping 
Syrians and to various United Nations agencies… and all options are on the table”. 

 

The Governments of Australia, Japan and most European countries pledged support to the two UN 
Response Plans, with a focus on funding protection, shelter, food security and health through 
UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP and the International Committee of the Red Cross. However, the 
Governments of Belgium, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States of America (with a total 
pledge of some USD 160 million) confirmed that, while supporting the humanitarian effort of the 
two UN Response Plans, they pledged to (among others), “provide flour to bakeries, provide winter 
supplies to those in communal shelters, and help refugees and their host communities in neighbouring 
countries”, and provide “food, protection and support to all of those affected by the conflict”, while 
“ensuring that coordinated aid reaches people across Syria, including agreed cross-line and cross-
border work” – suggesting openness to funding initiatives outside of the two UN Response Plans. 

 

Since the Kuwait donor conference, FAO has met with development partners based in Cairo, Amman, 
Beirut and Ankara, and there is a clear indication that bilateral donors and international organizations 
are willing to fund early recovery initiatives targeting the border areas and their host communities, 
including those related to the agriculture sector (e.g. transboundary animal and crop diseases and pests 
control, food safety control, and community-based income generation). 


4. AGRICULTURAL RESPONSE PLANS 

 

4.1 Objective 

 

Based on the situation analysis and needs assessment of the previous sections and taking into account 
the most likely scenario that the Syria crisis will continue for at least a further two years, FAO, in 
collaboration with the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and of Agriculture of Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and 
Turkey, have prepared a strategic response framework to support men, women, boys and girls of rural 
host communities, returnee farming families and farming refugees affected by the protracted crisis in 
Syria, with the objective of enabling conflict-affected rural communities and poor and vulnerable 
smallholder farming families to recover their agricultural livelihoods. 

 

FAO is one of several actors responding to the needs of conflict-affected farming families. In order to 
maximize their contribution, FAO and its development partners have identified the following areas in 
which the national and international humanitarian communities can offer a distinct added value, 
especially in terms of reaching the most vulnerable rural populations: 

 

(i) support to national Ministries of Agriculture and of Social Affairs in the strategic coordination 
of agricultural assistance provided by all stakeholders; 
(ii) technical advice in agricultural early recovery; 
(iii) material and financial support to the crops, livestock, forestry and fisheries subsectors; and 
(iv) capacity building of stakeholders (in particular, Ministries of Agriculture and smallholder 
farmers. organizations) to address the consequences of the Syria crisis (and any future crises in 
the region) in rural areas. 


 

4.2. FAO’s comparative advantage 

 

FAO, working together with other relevant actors, aims to leverage its comparative advantage in the 
areas listed below, by focusing on the development of two regional agricultural response plans and 
13 national agricultural response plans (summarized in Sections 4.3 and 4.4, and detailed as project 
profiles in Annex 4). 

 

FAO.s comparative advantage can be summarized as follows: 

 

. Building on FAO.s unique expertise and mandate on issues related to transboundary animal and 
crop diseases and pests – through its global Emergency Prevention System for Transboundary 
Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases, Global Framework for Transboundary Animal Diseases, 
ECTAD, International Plant Protection Convention, Wheat Rust Disease Global Programme and 
regional IPM networks. 
. Using FAO.s expertise on food processing, sanitary and phytosanitary measures – through its 
global leadership of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, International Network of Food Data 
Systems and Food for the Cities Network. 
. Unfolding FAO.s mandate on food security and agriculture-based livelihoods programming in 
conflict- and disaster-affected regions and countries of the world (e.g. the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Iraq, Pakistan, South Sudan, the Sudan and Yemen). 
. Building on FAO.s country programmes and privilege partnerships with Ministries of Agriculture 
– and the use of recently completed and ongoing agricultural food security projects, from which 
lessons can be drawn and emergency and early recovery responses can be launched (see Annex 1). 


 

 


4.3 Regional Agricultural Response Plans 

 

R1. Strengthening regional capacity for the control of transboundary animal diseases 

 

Syrian veterinary services and animal vaccination programmes have collapsed since early 2012 and the 
„number one. threat to the agriculture sector of the region is the spread of TADs from Syria to 
neighbouring countries. A significant number of cases of bluetongue, bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis, 
cutaneous leishmaniasis, FMD, LSD, PPR and rabies have already been identified along the Syrian 
border in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and/or Turkey at higher than normal levels (see Section 3.3.1 and 
Annex 1). April and November are the peak months for outbreaks of most of these TADs. To address 
such threats, veterinary services in Iraq and Lebanon are weak, in Jordan they are inconsistent (but weak 
in border areas) and in Turkey they are good (having received European Union support). In Egypt, FAO 
has a fully operational TAD control programme supporting the Government.s veterinary services. 

 

The focus of the programme would be on the effective control of TADs along the Syrian border areas of 
Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey and the strengthening of national capacities and regional coordination 
for better management of animal health systems and ensuring enhanced management of threats using 
stakeholder-participatory principles and approaches (see Annex 4-R1). The programme.s activities 
would be developed and implemented in an exclusive and collaborative manner by FAO.s global 
ECTAD, among countries and critical international partners in animal and public health (i.e. FAO, OIE 
and WHO) – by establishing the Regional Centre for Animal Health and Food Safety for the Near East. 

 

The anticipated outputs of the regional programme are: (i) an effective emergency response 
mechanism to any TAD outbreak in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey; (ii) prevention of TAD 
outbreaks in the region through improved surveillance systems in Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon; (iii) more 
efficient and effective regional coordination and networking systems for the monitoring and reporting 
of TADs; and (iv) building regional and national capacities for the control of TADs in the Near East. 

Programme duration: three years. Programme cost estimate13: USD 14.2 million. 

13 The exact cost of “expendable procurement” (such as animal vaccines) can only be determined when TAD 
threats have been identified and outbreaks confirmed. 

 

R2. Improved food quality control services along the Syrian border in Jordan and Lebanon 

 

Syrian phytosanitary and food safety control services have collapsed over the past 6 to 12 months. 
There has been increasing informal trade (smuggling) of food and agricultural commodities across 
borders with Syria in Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon following the crisis in Syria (see Section 3.3.2). There 
have also been significant changes in agricultural trading routes throughout the region. All of these 
developments have increased the risks of trading food at substandard quality as well as the threat of 
the plant transboundary diseases and pests accompanying the moving commodities, given the weak 
food safety and phytosanitary inspection systems in these countries – particularly at existing border 
crossings and especially so at the new border crossings. 

 

FAO proposes to build on its recently completed “Strengthening Production and Marketing of 
Lebanese Agricultural Products Project”, which provided support for food inspection services at the 
ports of entry in Lebanon. The proposed project will focus primarily on Jordan and Lebanon but, 
funds permitting, it could be extended to Iraq where similar problems exist at its border crossings with 
Syria (see Annex 4-R2). However, all neighbouring countries affected by the Syria crisis will benefit 
from knowledge-sharing under the project. The anticipated outputs of the programme are: (i) the 
handling of food import control in the countries is based on the analysis of food risks; (ii) risk-based 
food control is reinforced; (iii) border food inspectors are trained on risk-based control systems; 
(iv) phytosanitary capacity and infrastructure for inspection and control of transboundary crop 
diseases and pests are strengthened; (v) phytosanitary capacity for post-entry regulation measures and 
treatments are improved; and (vi) laboratory facilities are strengthened and staff associated with 
border food control and phytosanitary control are trained. 

 

Project duration: 18 months. Project cost estimate: USD 4.5 million. 

 


4.4 National Agricultural Response Plans 

 

4.4.1 Egypt 

 

E1. Strengthening urban and peri-urban nutritious and high-value crop production through 
expansion of urban farming in host communities of Syrian refugees in Egypt 

 

The influx of Syrian refugees into Cairo and other cities of Egypt is further increasing the critical 
importance of self-grown food for the poorest urban dwellers, particularly those living in households 
headed by women (see Section 3.2.2). The project will build on the successful experiences of FAO in 
Egypt and neighbouring countries with urban farming (i.e. „rooftop. and „vertical. gardening), as well 
as on the global “Food for the Cities” network of experts led by FAO (see Annex 4-E1). The project 
aims to provide drip-irrigated vegetable production units and training that will enable 500 Egyptian 
families, that are supporting Syrian refugees, to produce fresh, diversified and healthy food (and 
possibly generate income from the sales of any surplus production). It will also further strengthen 
cohesion and solidarity between communities hosting Syrian refugees. 

Project duration: one year. Project cost estimate: USD 440 000. 

 

E2. Enhancing nutritious food production and income generation of Egyptian communities 
hosting Syrian refugees 

 

There is a need to support poor communities hosting Syrian refugees in peri-urban areas of Cairo and 
other cities of Egypt to improve their food and nutrition security, and generate income to restore their 
livelihoods, as well as to assist refugees engage in part-time employment (see Section 3.2.2). Syrians 
have brought a tradition of milk processing, sweet manufacturing, baking and other similar activities to 
Egypt, and such skills need to be developed and transferred to the poorest of urban dwellers, particularly 
those living in households headed by women. For example, entrepreneurial Syrians have already started 
small milk processing units in the Cairo suburb of 6th of October as a source of employment and income. 

 

FAO proposes to build on the experiences of its ongoing Italian-funded project, “Improving 
Household Food and Nutrition Security in Egypt by Targeting Women and Youth” to enhance the 
capacity of refugees and host communities to benefit from the skills and experience of Syrian 
refugees, generate income and increase the availability of high quality, nutritious food in communities 
of greater Cairo where refugees reside. In this context, the project aims to provide fresh, diversified 
and healthy food to poor Egyptian families that are supporting Syrian refugees, and to refugees 
themselves, while strengthening cohesion and solidarity between communities (see Annex 4-E2). 

Project duration: one year. Project cost estimate: USD 462 000. 

 

4.4.2 Iraq 

 

I1. Improved animal health services (i.e. surveillance, vaccination campaigns, quarantine 
facilities, etc.) in the Syrian border areas of Iraq 

The Syria crisis is negatively affecting animal health services and herders in northwestern parts of 
Iraq (see Sections 3.2.3 and 3.3.1, and Annex 3). Syrian veterinary services collapsed during 2012 and 
Iraqi veterinary services are non-existent, especially in remote border areas with Syria. FAO proposes 
to support an additional component for the ongoing United Nations Development Group/Iraq Trust 
Fund-funded project implemented by FAO to “Develop the Performance of Small Ruminants (Sheep 
and Goats) and Improve the Level of Income for Small Breeders” in Ninawa Governorate, building on 
a project management unit that is already in place. 

 

The anticipated outputs of the component are: (i) numbers of sheep and goats vaccinated against important 
serotypes of TADs increased; (ii) veterinary and livestock extension services developed at the community 
level in Syrian border areas of Ninawa Governorate; and (iii) improved proper and timely communication 
of risks and outbreaks for rapid containment and TAD control programmes (see Annex 4-I1). 

Project duration: two years. Project cost estimate: USD 4.4 million. 


I2. Improved food production and marketing among host communities to Syrian refugees 
in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq 

 

The large number of Syrian refugees in the Kurdish Region of Iraq has created competition for labour 
as well as increased pressure on local food production (see Section 3.2.3). The agriculture sector in 
the Kurdish Region had been declining in recent times, and has been identified by both the 
Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government as an important area for rehabilitation 
and development (see Section 2.2.1). Refugees have come from a mix of urban and rural areas, a 
number of whom have agricultural backgrounds in various types of cereal crop and vegetable farming. 
Kurdish populations have become increasingly urbanized due to lack of investment in the agriculture 
sector and perceived opportunities. While 70 percent of the population lives in urban areas, food 
insecurity and poverty are disproportionately concentrated in the rural areas, where two-thirds of food 
insecure people are located. The effects of the influx of large numbers of refugees will be felt the most 
by those who are already vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity and poverty. 

 

To enhance food production and income-generating opportunities among vulnerable Kurdish rural 
households and the Syrian refugees they are hosting, FAO proposes to build on two recent FAO-
implemented projects funded by the Government of Australia and by the United Nations Development 
Group/Iraq Trust Fund, entitled “Emergency Support Project to Food Insecure Rural Households 
through Establishing Home Gardens in Iraq” and “Community Livelihoods and Micro-industry 
Support Project in Rural and Urban Areas of Northern Iraq”, respectively (see Annex 4-I2). 

Project duration: two years. Project cost estimate: USD 3.1 million. 

 

4.4.3 Jordan 

 

J1. Improved animal health services (i.e. surveillance, vaccination campaigns, quarantine 
facilities, etc.) in the Syrian border areas of Jordan 

 

The Syria crisis has negatively impacted on animal health services and livestock herders in northern 
areas of Jordan (see Sections 3.2.4 and 3.3.1, and Annex 3). Syrian veterinary services collapsed in 
2012, and unvaccinated Syrian animals are now crossing into Jordan. FMD, PPR, bluetongue, 
brucellosis, LSD and avian influenza (H9) have all been unofficially reported in the Syrian border 
areas of Jordan at higher than normal levels. While all Jordanian animals are registered and 
vaccinated, the country does not undertake any TAD surveillance and reporting, and its nearest 
quarantine facility is 35 km from the Syrian border. 

 

FAO proposes to work with the Government of Jordan.s Ministry of Agriculture and the Faculty of 
Veterinary Medicine of the Jordan University of Science and Technology (located in Irbid, northern 
Jordan) to strengthen: (i) animal health service delivery at the community level in the remote border 
areas; (ii) national disease surveillance, monitoring and reporting; and (iii) animal quarantine systems 
to a standard required to address the increasing threat of TADs. The anticipated outputs of the project 
are: (i) increased numbers of sheep, goats and cattle vaccinated against important serotypes of FMD 
and PPR; (ii) improved veterinary and livestock extension services at the community level in areas 
along the Syrian border; and (iii) improved, proper and timely communication of risks and outbreaks 
for rapid containment and TAD control programmes (see Annex4-J1). 

Project duration: 18 months. Project cost estimate: USD 2.1 million. 

 

J2. Restoring livelihoods and reducing land degradation through community-based range 
management initiatives among host communities in the Syrian border areas of Jordan 

 

The Government of Jordan has recently completed a poverty assessment and mapping exercise for the 
country. Moreover, WFP will soon launch a two-year, USD 23 million protracted relief and recovery 
(PRRO) project which will target „poverty pockets. of Jordan with demand-driven and community-
based “food assistance for assets” interventions. Several poverty pockets have been identified in the 
northern border areas with Syria. These are the very same communities that are now hosting the 
majority of Syrian refugees outside of the Zaatari Refugee Camp. Section 3.2.4 has highlighted the 


urgent need to restore the agricultural livelihoods of these host communities in northern Jordan 
through, for example, household and community-based income-generation initiatives. One such 
initiative could be through the rehabilitation of degraded rangelands (i.e. food- and cash-for-work and 
agricultural inputs). 

 

The Badia rangelands of northern Jordan, northwestern Iraq and southern Syria provide traditional 
grazing lands to herders who migrate with their sheep and goats in search of seasonal animal feeds. 
Increasing animal populations and the increased frequency and intensity of droughts have meant that, 
even before the Syria crisis, the rangelands were being overgrazed, the land was being degraded and 
the semi-desert steppes were being reduced to non-productive deserts (see Section 3.3.3). With the 
insecurity in Syria and the increased threat of TADs, herders are now concentrating on the margins of 
the Badia rangelands in northern Jordan and northwestern Iraq – and placing additional pressure on 
both Jordan.s fragile natural resource base and the impoverished socio-economic situation of many 
host communities to Syrian refugees in these areas. 

 

The Government of Jordan.s Ministry of Agriculture and WFP have subsequently requested FAO to 
mobilize resources and provide technical and financial assistance to support the new two-year PRRO 
project with interventions specifically targeted at the host communities of Syrian refugees in northern 
Jordan. The anticipated outputs of the project are: (i) household incomes generated by 20 000 farming 
families14 through community works to restore community assets and natural resources; (ii) household 
incomes generated and sustained by 5 000 farming families through post-harvest management 
initiatives, such as food processing, packaging and marketing; and (iii) capacities of stakeholders built 
(i.e. 100 staff of public and private service providers, 300 representatives of farmers. groups, and 
male and female beneficiary farmers) to financially and environmentally sustain the project.s 
interventions (see Annex 4-J2). 

14 Includes WFP.s food- and cash-for-work contributions. 

15 FAO contribution. 

Project duration: two years. Project cost estimate: USD 5.1 million.15 

 

 

J3. Improved smallholder vegetable crop protection in Jordan for the sale of quality, 
nutritious and affordable produce to Syrian refugee camps and host communities 

 

The Syria crisis has transformed a number of seasonal Syrian migrant workers into longer-term 
destitute refugees and heightened the threat of transboundary crop diseases and pests (see Sections 
3.2.4 and 3.3.2). At the same time, a number of farmers in the Jordan Valley who used to employ 
Syrian labour have now become host families to those labourers and their families. Jordanian farmers 
are already facing significant challenges in relation to the viability of their enterprises. Indeed, 
increasing production costs and endemic pests and diseases, such as tomato leaf miner (Tuta 
absoluta), wheat rust and fruit flies are compounding the efforts of smallholder farming families to 
make a living out of farming. The economic cost of Syrian refugees on Jordanian farming 
communities is further exacerbating their vulnerability status. However, the influx of refugees could 
also represent a market opportunity for Jordanian farmers, and access to fresh, nutritious and 
affordable products, particularly in camps and host community centres, should be encouraged. 

 

FAO proposes to extend its recently launched project, “Management of Tomato Borer: Tuta Absoluta in 
the Near East Region” and a recently completed FAO project funded by the Government of Italy 
“Regional Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Programme in the Near East” to focus on: (i) reducing the 
prevalence of fruit and vegetable pests (particularly fruit flies and Tuta absoluta) in production areas 
hosting and employing Syrian refugees; and (ii) increasing the availability of and access to fresh, 
nutritious and affordable vegetables in refugee camps and community centres in Jordan; while 
(iii) preserving the capacity of some 10 000 Jordanian smallholder farmers to employ around 
10 000 seasonal Syrian workers; and (iv) creating income-generation opportunities at Syrian refugee 
camp and community centre-levels (with a focus on some 300 women) through the establishment of 
retail shops for the sale of quality fruit and vegetables and other nutritious foodstuffs (see Annex 4-J3). 

Project duration: two years. Project cost estimate: USD 4.3 million. 


J4. Enhancing income generation and nutritious food production through the introduction of 
small-scale household food processing facilities in the Zaatari Refugee Camp and among 
host communities of Syrian refugees in the border areas of Jordan 

 

There is a need to reduce poverty, malnutrition and general hopelessness among refugees in the 
Zaatari Refugee Camp and refugee community centres in areas along the Syrian border and to restore 
the livelihoods of impoverished smallholder farming families of border communities hosting refugees 
that have been seriously affected by the Syria crisis (see Sections 2.1.3 and 3.2.4). FAO proposes to: 
(i) assist the Ministry of Agriculture, local NGOs and CBOs to improve income-generating 
opportunities for 500 Syrian refugee families and Jordanian smallholder farming families (from host 
communities) through the transfer and adoption of new food processing and marketing technologies 
and practices; and (ii) reduce malnutrition among 15 000 Syrian refugee families and Jordanian 
smallholder farming families (from host communities) through improved access to quality, safe and 
nutritious foods, such as fresh and processed vegetables, fruits, dairy products, eggs and fresh meat, 
and improved knowledge in food nutrition and health behaviour (see Annex 4-J4). 

Project duration: one year. Project cost estimate: USD 616 000. 

This project proposal could be up-scaled to USD 2 million over a two-year timeframe as an alternative to 
selected (post-harvest management) components of projects J2 and J3. 

 

 

J5. Increased household egg production among host communities of Syrian refugees in the 
border areas of Jordan 

 

The increased demand for poultry products in Jordan and a reduced supply from Syria has more than 
tripled the price of eggs in the country (see Section 3.1.5). Prior to the Syria crisis, Jordan was almost 
totally dependent on imports from Syria to meet its demand for eggs. Poultry production is the most 
affected agro-industry in Syria, with the total destruction of large poultry farms in areas such as Idleb, 
Homs, and Rural Damascus. It is estimated that the demand for eggs in Jordan will increase from 
820 million in 2012 to 1.2 billion in 2013 with the increasing influx of Syrian refugees. The Government 
of Jordan.s Ministry of Agriculture has reported a shortfall of some 400 million eggs in 2012. 

 

FAO proposes to assist the Ministry of Agriculture, local NGOs and CBOs to increase village and 
household egg production among some 40 to 80 host communities of Syrian refugees in the border 
areas of northern Jordan. The anticipated outputs of the project are: (i) reintroduction of 
village/household poultry production systems accompanied by improved poultry farming skills of 
some 2 000 beneficiary farming families; (ii) enhanced family nutrition through the increased 
consumption of poultry products, in particular fresh eggs; (iii) improved household income 
opportunities through the sale of eggs to ready markets; and (iv) sustainable value chains for the 
supply of poultry inputs and marketing of eggs from/beyond the local markets (see Annex 4-J5). 

Project duration: one year. Project cost estimate: USD 1.1 million. 

 

4.4.4 Lebanon 

 

L1. Emergency vaccination and feeding of Bedouin herds grazing in areas along the Syria-
Lebanon border 

 

The Syria crisis has negatively impacted on animal health services and livestock herders in northern 
and eastern parts of Lebanon (see Sections 3.2.4 and 3.3.1, and Annex 3). Syrian veterinary services 
collapsed during 2012, and Lebanese veterinary services are non-existent, especially in remote border 
areas. FAO proposes to work with the Government of Lebanon.s Ministry of Agriculture, private 
sector veterinarians and trained community animal health workers to strengthen animal health service 
delivery at the community level in the border areas, national disease surveillance, monitoring and 
reporting, and animal quarantine systems to a standard required to address the increasing threat of 
TADs in Lebanon. In addition, high feed prices and pressure on seasonal pastures and rangelands are 
forcing Lebanese farmers out of business. For example, some 12 000 Syrian Mountain and Shami 
goats have crossed into northern Lebanon and settled – bringing the added threats of overgrazing, land 


degradation and potential desertification. Lebanese returnees used to benefit from Syria.s (winter) 
seasonal pastures and generous feed subsidies but, like free vaccines, these sources have disappeared. 

 

The anticipated outputs of the project are: (i) increased numbers of sheep, goats and cattle vaccinated 
against important serotypes of FMD and PPR; (ii) veterinary and livestock extension services 
developed at the community level in remote areas along the Syrian border; (iii) improved, proper and 
timely communication of risks and outbreaks for rapid containment and TAD control programmes; 
and (iv) increased number of livestock keepers able to retain and make a living from their herds of 
sheep and goats, and dairy cattle in the medium term (see Annex 4-L1). 

Project duration: two years. Project cost estimate: USD 5.2 million. 

 

 

L2. Assistance to returnees and host communities in the impoverished Syria border areas of 
Lebanon through the recovery and rehabilitation of smallholder agricultural production 
and marketing 

 

The Syria crisis has affected 30 000 poor smallholder Lebanese returnees who have been farming 
inside Syria for generations, viz: (i) they have lost all of their assets (including houses, farm buildings, 
livestock, fruit trees, farm machinery and irrigation equipment); (ii), they, and their Lebanese 
relatives, are now obliged to host their former Syrian neighbours (many of whom are living in 
unsanitary tented accommodation); and (iii) they have lost access to subsidized Syrian agricultural 
inputs, such as fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, animal feed, vaccines and animal medicines, and the 
ability to generate income through cross-border trading in such goods (see Section 3.2.5). The highly 
vulnerable returnees are now hosted in some 136 villages of all districts bordering Syria, most of 
which represent the poorest population pockets of the country (e.g. Akkar, Baalbek, Hasbaya, Hermel 
and Marjaayoun) that were already the target of the Government of Lebanon.s social safety-net 
programmes prior to the Syria crisis. 

 

FAO proposes to extend its recently completed “Strengthening Production and Marketing of Lebanese 
Agricultural Products Project” and expand its ongoing “Recovery and Rehabilitation of the Dairy Sector 
in Bekaa Valley and Hermel-Akkar Uplands Project” and “Emergency Livelihoods Support for 
Vulnerable Lebanese Who Fled from Syria to Lebanon Seeking Refuge and their Hosting Families 
Project” (where FAO project management units are already in place). The aim is to target those 
Lebanese returnees and their host families with demand-driven, community-based and participatory 
value chain approaches to agricultural livelihood recovery and rehabilitation through the provision of 
agricultural livelihood packages selected from a menu of proven and sustainable interventions. Such 
interventions include: (i) restocking and feeding of sheep and goats; (ii) household dairy development 
and community-based milk collection; (iii) land clearing and fruit tree planting; (iv) rehabilitation of 
small-scale farmer-managed irrigation schemes; (v) integrated homestead farming; (vi) homestead food 
processing and improved nutrition; and (vii) group-based agroprocessing and marketing. The project 
would also build the capacities of beneficiary farmers and beneficiary groups through technology 
transfer and participatory learning of new, improved production and post-harvest management 
technologies and practices, such as farmer field schools (see Annex 4-L2). 

Project duration: two years. Project cost estimate: USD 7.5 million. 

 

4.4.5 Turkey 

 

T1. Support to ‘micro-gardening’ initiatives for improved food nutrition and income 
generation in selected Syrian refugee camps of Turkey 

 

There is a need to increase income-generation opportunities among Syrian refugees in Turkish camps 
(see Sections 3.2.6 and 3.4.1). There is insufficient space for refugees to operate kitchen gardens to 
grow vegetables and rear small livestock, such as chickens and rabbits. However, there is evidence 
from some camps that refugees are growing vegetables and herbs in small containers around, or 
hanging from, their tents and containerized housing units. Moreover, the Provincial Government of 
Kilis has recently announced that all new Syrian refugee camps in that province will include areas 


designated for refugees to grow fruits, vegetables, herbs, etc. – more for reasons of occupational 
therapy than opportunities for income generation and improved diets. FAO proposes to draw on its 
global experience of working with urban refugees and provide technical assistance to Provincial 
Directorates for Food, Agriculture and Livestock, AFAD and local NGOs in the establishment of 
short-season „micro-gardens. within the limited space of refugee camps. The project also proposes to 
build the capacity of impoverished refugees (particularly women and youth) to generate income from 
the sale of produce grown in the gardens, while improving their nutritional status in the camps. 

Project duration: one year. Project cost estimate: USD 506 000. 

 

 

T2. Recovery and rehabilitation of smallholder agricultural production and marketing in 
the impoverished Syria border areas of Turkey 

 

The Syria crisis has severely impacted smallholder families farming within 5 km of the Syria border 
in Gaziantep, Hatay, Kilis and Saniurfa Provinces (see Section 3.2.6). They have lost more than half 
of their annual household income as a result of: (i) a more than 40 percent fall in farm-gate prices for 
grapes, olives and pistachio nuts, as Syrian refugees are returning to their farms, harvesting their 
crops, and returning to Turkey to sell their produce to processors/wholesalers at much reduced prices; 
(ii) shortages of animal fodder, and high animal feed prices and vaccination costs; (iii) insecurity 
close to the border, looting/damage to irrigation equipment/structures and loss of fruit trees; (iv) loss 
of local cross-border trading opportunities with neighbouring communities; and (v) high agricultural 
input and fuel prices, limited access to agricultural credit and poor dairy animal hygiene (the latter, 
not as a consequence of the Syria crisis but a compounding issue). 

 

The Government of Turkey.s Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock has subsequently requested 
FAO to mobilize resources and offer technical and financial assistance to support a project providing 
50 percent grant assistance and capacity development to smallholder farming families affected by the 
Syria crisis. The assistance would include provision of livelihood recovery packages, such as animal 
fodder and vaccines, wheat and lentil seeds, fertilizers, irrigation equipment, organic farming 
equipment and materials, tractor spare parts and fuel, and household agroprocessing and storage (see 
Annex 4-T2). The packages would be supplemented with training in good agricultural practices, 
animal husbandry and post-harvest management through group-based participatory learning 
approaches, such as farmer field schools. It is proposed that the project be funded or co-funded by the 
ongoing FAO-Turkey Partnership Programme being implemented by FAO, following the modalities 
of the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock-supported “Rural Development Support 
Programme” and “South-Eastern Anatolia Project Action Plan” (see Annex 1.6). 

Project duration: two years. Project cost estimate: USD 12 million. 

 

4.5 Indicative cost of the Regional and National Response Plans 

 

The overall cost for the two regional and 13 national response programmes and projects is estimated 
at USD 65.5 million. Details are provided in Annex 4 and can be summarized as follows: 

- Regional: USD 18 700 000 
- Egypt: USD 902 000 
- Iraq: USD 7 500 000 
- Jordan: USD 13 216 000 
- Lebanon: USD 12 700 000 
- Turkey: USD 12 506 000 


 


4.6 Medium- and long-term support to agricultural trade and marketing 

 

Section 3.1 has highlighted how the Syria crisis has impacted negatively on the neighbouring 
countries of Syria, resulting in: (i) significant decline in food and agricultural exports and loss of 
markets; (ii) disruptions to food imports and agricultural inputs; (iii) loss of incomes at farm gate and 
along the agricultural commodity chain; and (iv) increased risks and threats related to food safety and 
transboundary animal and plant pests and diseases. The proposed emergency and recovery actions 
would need to be complemented with, and embedded in, a medium- and long-term response strategy. 

 

To cope with these challenges, four areas for medium- and long-term response are considered 
critical, as outlined below. 

 

1. Promoting agricultural value chains for smallholder farmers in affected areas 

 

The disruption of trade and the changes in trading are affecting many smallholders and other 
stakeholders along the agricultural commodity chain. Examples of commodities that are negatively 
affecting the incomes of a wide range of households in hosting communities include citrus, apples and 
olives in Akkar and Hermel in Lebanon, and vegetables in the Jordan Valley. Two initiatives of 
particular relevance include: (i) expansion of cold storage; and (ii) olive oil processing facilities and 
marketing, viz: 

(i) Assisting small-scale producers and farmers’ cooperatives in establishing modern cold storage 
facilities. Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey are known for their high quality fruit and 
vegetables. However, with the changing trading routes, many farmers and traders are not able to 
cope because of the high perishability of their produce and the lack of necessary cold storage 
facilities, particularly at small production centres. There is a need to improve the post-harvest 
handling system of fruit (particularly citrus and apples), train farmers and small-scale traders on 
post-harvest handling, and replace old fruit stocks and introduce new varieties for which there is 
demand and/or better prices can be obtained. Establishing cold storage will permit up to six-
month storage of fruit, such as apple and citrus, and will substantially increase farmers' income 
and reduce post-harvest losses. In addition, better post-harvest handling and processing will create 
more value addition and reduce losses. 

(ii) Olive oil processing, packing and marketing. The current quantities of olive oil produced, if well 
marketed, would provide revenues to a large number of smallholder farming families and 
labourers from within and outside the affected areas of Lebanon and Jordan, and would allow 
more attention to be paid to the olive trees, which are highly resistant to natural resource hazards 
and water scarcity. In addition, the potential for expanding the production and marketing of high 
quality olive oil is significant. This can best be obtained if processing units are established with a 
better marketing strategy for the product inside and outside of Jordan and Lebanon. Such an 
initiative would enhance the cost-effective and environmentally sustainable production of high 
quality olive oil as a means to improve the livelihoods of smallholder olive farmers and promote 
overall development in host communities. It would raise the earnings of farmers from olive oil, 
adding value to the commodity in terms of productivity and the quality of olive oil through 
diversifying and improving the market potential of olive oil. 

 

2. Ensuring availability of adequate food supplies at the regional and national levels 

 

In view of the significant increase in demand for imported cereals, owing to the deterioration in cereal 
production in Syria, it extremely important that countries in the region adopt the necessary measures 
to avoid any massive shortages in basic food supplies. At the regional level, governments need to 
coordinate their import policy and grain storage plans to absorb the expected shock. Appropriate 
actions also need to be put in place to boost domestic production of cereals and other basic food 
commodities through improved productivity, while ensuring that land and water resources are put to 
their highest-value and most sustainable use (e.g. conservation agriculture, IPM and more efficient 
on-farm water management systems). 

 

 


3. Diversification of traditional agricultural markets 

 

The Syria crisis has demonstrated that countries of the Near East Region are over-reliant on Syria, the 
Gulf States and Saudi Arabia for their agricultural markets. There is a need for countries such as 
Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon to seek alternative markets for their agricultural produce in Europe, 
central Asia, etc. To some degree, Turkey has already achieved this goal and the other neighbouring 
countries need to follow with trade promotion and development initiatives – however, this comes with 
all of the regulatory requirements of food quality and safety required of countries from those regions. 
No longer can Lebanese apples, for example, be loaded loosely into a truck and carted off to Syria and 
Iraq without quality control, phytosanitary inspection, proper packaging, etc. 

 

 

4. Strengthening the regulatory, institutional and human infrastructure for food control 

 

To strengthen and sustain the food control service along borders, there is a need to review and 
develop the regulatory system and certification programmes, strengthen/establish necessary laboratory 
facilities, train the required number of quality staff and strengthen institutional establishment to 
ensure compliance with internationally recognized standards and procedures in food quality and 
safety, and sanitary and phytosanitary measures.

5. Turkey 

 

(A total of three priority areas have been identified, of which two are relevant to a Syria response) 

 

Priority Area 1 – Food and nutrition security and food safety 

This includes the improvement in food safety systems; supporting food and nutrition security; 
increasing the food supply value chain; accelerating economic growth and alleviating rural poverty; 
human resource development in small- and medium-size food processing and selling enterprises; and 
raising public awareness on food safety, organic farming, good agricultural practices, natural foods 
and food-environment relations. 

 

Priority Area 2 – Sustainable use of natural resources and forestry 

This includes sustainable land management and climate-friendly agriculture, such as the promotion of 
conservation agriculture; transboundary pest and disease monitoring, surveillance and control; 
promotion of IPM and integrated pesticide management. 

 

A prime funding mechanism upon which an agricultural response to the Syria crisis in Turkey could 
be built is the Government of Turkey-funded and FAO-implemented FAO-Turkey Partnership 
Programme, which has provided USD 10 million in support of 30 subregional, multi-country and 
national agricultural projects in Central Asia and Turkey since 2009. Ongoing projects of relevance to 
the Syria crisis include: “Capacity Development for Analysis and Strengthening of Agricultural 
Innovation Systems in Central Asia and Turkey”; “Initiative for Pesticides and Pest Management in 
Central Asia and Turkey”; and “Enhancing Organic Farming in Turkey”. 

 

Other potential funding and implementation mechanisms include a Government of Turkey-funded 
programme implemented by the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock “Rural Development 
Support Programme”, which has provided 50 percent grants to small- and medium-scale farmers for 
agroprocessing, packaging, wrapping and storage equipment/facilities, and farm and irrigation 
machinery/equipment (2006 to present; USD 750 million); and the “South-Eastern Anatolia Project 
Action Plan”, which allocated USD 800 million in subsidies for the period 2008 to 2012 to undertake 
economic development in the local agriculture sector, improve local rural infrastructure and build the 
capacity of local institutions. 

 

Recently completed and ongoing FAO programmes and projects upon which an agriculture response 
to the Syria crisis could draw lessons include: 

 

(i) FAO-funded project, “Development and Implementation of the Integrated and Controlled Crop 
Management in Turkey” (2010 to 2013; USD 436 000); and 
(ii) Government of Spain-funded programme, implemented by FAO, International Labour 
Organization and IOM, “Growth with Decent Work for All: National Youth Employment 
Programme and Pilot Implementation in Antalya – Youth, Employment and Migration” (2009 
to 2012; FAO share: USD 660 000). 


 

6. FAO regional programmes 

 

(i) Integrated pest management 

 

“Management of the Peach Fruit Fly in the Middle East and North Africa” (2003 to 2004; 
USD 380 000; FAO-funded). This programme assisted the Ministries of Agriculture of Egypt, Iran, 
Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen to eliminate peach fruit fly from specific areas through the 


identification and strengthening of phytosanitary measures implemented in order to prevent the 
introduction and spread of the pest to non-infested areas in the regions. The programme: (i) trained 
government and industry personnel and phytosanitary officers in surveillance and management 
techniques and pest risk analysis and mitigation; (ii) reviewed and updated phytosanitary legislation 
of participating countries; (iii) established national and regional vigilance/surveillance systems; and 
(iv) prepared, in each country, an emergency response capability to eliminate peach fruit fly outbreaks 
and prevent its spread. 

 

“Regional Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Programme in the Near East” (2004 to 2011; 
USD 7.6 million; Government of Italy-funded; FAO-implemented). This programme reduced 
pesticide use through community-based participatory processes, such as farmer field schools in 
Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and 
Yemen. This, in turn, contributed to the protection of farming communities, their environment and the 
health of consumers, as well as expanded local and export markets for high-value crops in line with 
European Union standards and rules for international trade. The programme provided technical 
assistance to facilitate the exchange of expertise and implement pilot activities in the field. For its 
implementation, the programme formed and built on partnerships among farming communities (and 
their members and organizations), relevant NGOs, government units/line departments, research and 
university institutions, and other FAO national projects. These partnerships finally merged into a 
forum for discussion and policy development on IPM at national and regional levels. 

 

“Management of Tomato Borer: Tuta Absoluta in the Near East Region” (2013 to 2014; 
USD 440 000; FAO-funded). The project will cover the most affected countries in the region (i.e. 
Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen). It will strengthen regional collaboration, 
coordination, and information and knowledge exchange in the management of Tuta absoluta, as well 
as assist in mapping the pest and containing its spread within the region. It will also contribute to the 
countries. capacity development in the management of Tuta absoluta based on IPM approaches with a 
focus on the capacity development of National Plant Protection Organizations in pest surveillance, 
biological control development and phytosanitary measures. Furthermore, the project will assist 
countries in developing a national sustainable strategy for the management of Tuta absoluta. 

 

“Policy and Technical Support for National Contingency Planning in Countries at Direct Risk 
of New Virulent Races of Wheat Rust" (2010 to 2012; USD 185 000; Government of Italy-funded; 
FAO-implemented). This regional crop disease and pest control project targeted nine countries, 
including Egypt, Syria and Turkey. 

 

(ii) Transboundary animal diseases 

 

Following HPAI outbreaks in the region, the Regional Animal Health Centre for the Middle East 
(RAHC-NE) was established by the FAO global Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal 
Disease Operations (ECTAD) in Beirut during 2007, through an agreement between FAO, the World 
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Ministry of Agriculture of Lebanon. The RAHC-NE 
played an important role in regional coordination and protection of human and animal health efforts, 
timely implementation of effective TAD control strategies that led to progressive disease control, 
increases in animal production efficiencies and opening of new markets for healthy livestock and 
trade of animal products. A lack of sustained financial support led to the closure of RAHC-NE in 
2011. However, FAO-ECTAD has retained a national TAD programme in Egypt – where there is an 
ISO-accredited animal disease diagnostic laboratory (i.e. National Laboratory for the Quality Control 
of Poultry Production), which has been supported by FAO over the past decade. Furthermore, Turkey 
has ISO-accredited and Category PI-3 laboratories, a strong technical capacity for laboratory analysis, 
and extensive and effective public veterinary services – again, supported by FAO in recent times. 

The RAHC-NE was responsible for the implementation of USD 1 million worth of TAD control 
interventions in the region, primarily focusing on HPAI. In this context, FAO developed and 
implemented an action plan for HPAI preparedness and response in the Middle East region to 
strengthen veterinary services and to build human and physical resource capacity in response to 
outbreaks. FAO also provided technical assistance to member countries to finalize their dossier for 
accreditation of rinderpest freedom according to OIE “pathway”. Assistance was specifically provided 


to some countries to carry out the required surveillance for rinderpest freedom accreditation. 
Furthermore, FAO was responsible for advancing practical knowledge and experience in the 
prevention and control of other TADs and zoonoses in various countries of the region. Examples of 
these include foot-and-mouth disease, peste des petits ruminants, bluetongue, brucellosis, lumpy skin 
disease, avian influenza and bovine tuberculosis. 

One follow-up regional project to RAHC-NE is the FAO-funded “Strengthening Veterinary 
Quarantine Capacity in the Middle East Region” (2011 to 2013; USD 307 000), which has assessed 
the capacity of veterinary quarantine systems and provided training on import risk analysis and 
quarantine to the beneficiary countries.

ANNEX 3: IMPACTS OF THE SYRIA CRISIS ON THE LIVESTOCK SUBSECTOR 
OF THE NEAR EAST REGION 

 

1. Iraq 

 

Animal movements 

 

Traditional livestock movements across Iraq in the form of transhumance are very common. The 
cross-border movement from winter grazing in Syria to summer grazing in northern Iraq has been 
disrupted. The livestock-keeping Bedouins of the Syria/Iraq border areas are of the same tribe and 
used to move their animals in a traditional grazing management system called Hema. 

 

Biosecurity and animal health threats 

 

The collapse of field veterinary services in Syria is a serious threat to Iraqi livestock as the potential 
for outbreaks and the spread of TADs is real. PPR and FMD are the most feared diseases in Iraq. 
Unvaccinated animals are crossing into Iraq. Vaccination programmes, disease surveillance and 
animal quarantine in high-risk border areas are not in place. Emergency vaccination against priority 
TADs and capacity building of veterinarians to train community animal health workers are urgently 
needed to strengthen animal health services in the rural areas of Nineveh Province. Food safety check 
points and veterinary quarantine facilities are also much needed. 

 

Impacts on animal feeds 

 

Feed price has increased in Iraq due to the increased livestock and trade disruptions. The Ninawa 
Governorate of Iraq, which borders Syria, is endowed with huge livestock resources, mainly sheep, 
goats and dairy cattle. The deterioration of natural grazing land (rangelands) is getting worse due to 
overgrazing as animals are forced to stay in Iraq throughout the year. More animals are moving out of 
Syria, resulting in the incursion of unpalatable invasive species in Syria and overgrazing of desirable 
species in Iraq. The high animal feed prices and lack of animal health services in the marginal areas 
bordering Syria have seriously affected sheep and goat producers. Loss of livestock assets among the 
poor is eminent as livestock keepers are selling part or all of their livestock assets to purchase animal 
feeds and to cover their immediate family expenses. 

 

Livestock development 

 

FAO.s present Programme for Iraq indicates that the livestock subsector is a first priority for the 
Government of Iraq in its Five-Year Development Plan (2009 to 2014) and the Road Map for 
integrating emergency and development. Sector-specific priorities include: increased milk production 
by increasing herd size with the import of selected breeds; the establishment of milk processing plants 
and of modern slaughtering facilities; improved veterinary services to prevent and control animal 
diseases; and increased production through the development of improved Awassi sheep and 
Shami/Damascus goat breeds. 

 

 

2. Jordan 

 

Animal movements and trade 

 

The number of animals crossing the Jordanian border has increased as there is no official import ban 
placed on Syrian livestock and animal products. Government authorities, however, say that the border 
is secure and there is no illegal movement of animals. The movement of Bedouins across borders is 
said not to be at appreciable levels because there is not much grazing in the desert area of Jordan 
bordering Syria, which is the same on the Syrian side. On the other hand, the Ministry of Agriculture 
recently disclosed that Jordan is importing sheep and goats from Syria. It has imported 300 000 goats 
in 2012 alone for slaughter/meat. Jordan has also been importing sheep from Romania and Slovenia 
using the Tartous port transiting through Syria, whose share from this route slowed down or is coming 
to a halt due to the insecurity. The trade of animal products is ongoing between the two countries; 


Syrian communities that fled the crisis are organizing themselves to create more business, as 
increasingly more Syrian products are demanded by Syrian refugees and Jordanian returnees. 

 

Dairy products are particularly needed by Syrians given that dairy consumption is very much 
entrenched in their traditions and, with more refugees, there is greater demand. The reduced price of 
sheep has led to competition in a limited market and is pushing smallholder Jordanian farmers out of 
business. This is because many Syrian sheep and goats are being sold in local markets for lower prices 
than Jordanians will accept. 

 

Biosecurity and animal health threats 

 

Jordan imports Awassi sheep and Shami goats from Syria. Transit of Awassi sheep to Saudi Arabia 
stopped since August 2012, when the trade route was disrupted and vaccination programmes in Syria 
collapsed. The Veterinary Quarantine Facility of Jordan is located 35 km from the Syrian border and 
does not comply with minimum international biosecurity standards. TADs of major concern include 
FMD-SAT2, PPR and LSD. Authorities fear FMD-SAT2 as Lebanon imports animals from countries 
where the strain is endemic; unofficial cases of SAT2 were reported and the border between Lebanon 
and Syria is porous. Recently, a PPR outbreak was (unofficially) reported in small ruminants and LSD 
in dairy cows at Al Mafraq near the Syrian border; however, government authorities have dismissed 
such claims. It is worth nothing that the contentious bluetongue outbreak of 2011, diagnosed by the 
Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Jordan University of Science and Technology, was not officially 
communicated to the rest of the world. According to WHO, cases of influenza viruses have increased 
in the region. They reported three fatalities out of 41 cases in Jordan and 30 fatalities out of 150 
confirmed cases among Palestinians in the neighbouring West Bank due to H1N1 virus (swine flu). 
New emerging corona virus has resulted in two fatalities in Jordan. The caseload of cutaneous 
leishmaniasis is also increasing in Zattari Refugee Camp. A joint FAO/WHO mission for their “One 
Health” approach to disease control is envisaged. 

 

The Ministry of Agriculture of Jordan provides free mandatory vaccination against FMD 
(i.e. three times per year) and PPR for registered (ear-tagged) sheep and goats. Animal identification, 
which started in Jordan during 2008, is being used to ensure that animals are vaccinated against FMD 
and PPR. It is also one criterion for the animal feed subsidy. Vaccinating cattle against FMD (where 
the cost is borne by the owners) is mandatory to receive feed subsidies for their small ruminants and 
follow-up veterinary services if farmers own both. Feeds for cattle and buffaloes are not subsidized. It 
is believed that farmers who own cattle are better-off compared to those keeping only sheep and 
goats. 

 

FAO.s advice to ramp up vaccination against major TADs, such as FMD and PPR, across the 
Jordan/Syria border has been well received by government authorities. Disease reporting systems and 
active animal disease surveillance in high-risk border areas are not in place. TAD surveillance for 
major threats such as FMD (including new strains), PPR and LSD is urgently required. 

 

Impacts on animal feeds 

 

The Syria crisis has impacted feed imports into Jordan, particularly cheaper feeds from Ukraine. The 
impact of recent droughts in the United States of America and the resulting price hike in animal feed 
have been felt in Jordan, although this has been normalized recently. Jordan also imports soya bean 
for poultry production. The increased cost of feed during 2011 resulted in a reduction in egg 
production from 900 to 820 million eggs in 2012. The changing import routes from transit through 
Syria to another source and route including Haifa have impacted the price of feed, which is directly 
felt by cattle and poultry producers. The price of feed (wheat and barley) is subsidized and fixed at 
USD 250 per tonne for sheep and goat owners, while international market prices can reach up to 
USD 500 per tonne. Some exchange of subsidized feed between sheep and goat farmers and cattle 
farmers has developed a black market for cattle owners to increase their margins. Rangeland 
degradation is being reported as far as the Jordan Valley by Bedouins coming from Syria. Farmers. 
increased demand for animal feeds has therefore seriously affected prices and supplies. 

 

 


Impacts on animal products 

 

The amount of livestock and animal products on the Jordanian market has changed. High demand for 
eggs and dairy products is straining the local supply. The price of eggs has tripled. Jordan.s annual 
production was 820 million eggs in 2012. A deficit in the supply of eggs has already been felt in 
Jordan and demand is expected to reach to 1.2 billion eggs in 2013. The authorities link this to the 
increased demand for eggs by the Syrian refugees because of their tradition of consuming eggs and 
egg products. The same trend is observed for dairy products, and for the same reason. The claimed 
increase in the importation of livestock and animal products needs quantification. Likewise, the claim 
that the price of meat in Syria is higher than that in Jordan needs further clarification, and is not 
convincing given that Syrians are forced to sell their animals at low prices due to reduced access to 
grazing areas and the disruption to feed supplies and veterinary services. 

 

 

3. Lebanon 

 

Livestock is the mainstay of the rural economy of Lebanon and has a significant impact on rural well-
being and poverty alleviation, particularly in marginal areas bordering Syria. The subsector is a major 
economic activity, generating significant household cash income through sales of live animals and/or 
animal products. Many people, mainly youth and women, are usually involved in milking, animal 
care, milk processing or industrial poultry enterprises. 

 

Animal movements and trade 

 

Animal keepers and communities depending on livestock for their livelihoods are highly affected as 
prices have dropped for their cattle by up to 60 percent, and by an unspecified amount for their sheep 
and goats. This has a devastating impact on resource-poor rural households. Uncontrolled movement 
of animals in the border areas is a norm rather than an exception in the Syria/Lebanon border areas. 
Historically, many Lebanese farmers have retained their land inside Syria while keeping their 
Lebanese identity. The border is therefore porous and the usual practice is that sheep and goats are 
moved between the two countries as normal transhumance (in Syria during winter and Lebanon 
during summer). This practice of moving animals also applies to Syrian livestock farmers. 

 

During the Syria crisis, however, the extent and scale of livestock movement is much greater as a 
large number of sheep, goats and dairy cattle have been brought into Lebanon on a permanent basis. 
Syrians fleeing the crisis have been forced to bring their animals as this is the only asset that they can 
transport. Most of their crops and fruit trees have perished in their fields. The animals coming from 
Syria are sold for a third of their market price inside Lebanon, both for meat and for breeding 
purposes. The border is porous with only 5 percent of the animals being imported legally; however, 
smuggling has kept the price of meat relatively steady as Syrian animals are sold at a lower rate than 
local animals. Some animals were taken by their buyers to various places deep within the Lebanese 
territory – without quarantine and vaccination. 

 

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, animal trade between the two countries is limited to certain 
commodities and Lebanon is an importer of livestock and meat, mainly Awassi mutton. Half of 
Lebanon.s needs of live sheep and mutton used to come from Syria. Lebanon has a long border with 
Syria; illegal entry of animals from Syria to Lebanon is happening at a much higher rate than before 
the crisis. Lebanon also imports sheep from the Sudan, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Somalia, and is now 
increasing the quantity of livestock and animal products imported, as well as the number of countries 
from which it imports. However, some of these goods are illegally transported and therefore affect 
local meat prices. 

 

White cheese used to be imported from Syria, but now the strategy is to resort to Egypt for such 
products, with a possible increase in price. Due to the smuggling of sheep, the price of mutton has 
been stable so far. The Ministry of Agriculture claims that they have intensified their surveillance in 
the neighbouring areas, which is not the case according to information on ground. 

 

 


Biosecurity and animal health threats 

 

The field veterinary service in the border areas of Lebanon could be considered as very weak or nil. 
For areas from Zahle to the Hermel and Akkar, only two private/public veterinarians were available 
per type of veterinary service. In Hermel town, for example, no veterinary quarantine facility was 
available at the crossing points along with border police and customs check points. The Ministry of 
Agriculture fears that the collapse of TAD control in Syria will impact Lebanon. The country needs 
support in surveillance, quarantine, vaccination and disease control programmes. The Ministry is 
recruiting 200 veterinary surgeons, but this is too late for these present threats. 

 

Many Syrian horse breeders requested Lebanon for the transfer of their horses and an exceptional 
permit was granted to allow entrance of special value Arabian horses, with the condition that they are 
quarantined and kept in separate places. Syrian Arabian horses were tested for glanders protein in 
isolated areas. Lebanon is maintaining disease freedom – a requirement to return to European Union 
markets. The European Union has banned the import of Arabian horses from Lebanon for fear of the 
introduction of glanders, which the country has declared. Lebanon has contained the disease and 
would want their efforts recognized by the European Union for lifting the import ban. However, the 
introduction of Syrian horses from where glanders is endemic might compromise Lebanon.s 
application for lifting of the ban. 

 

Field veterinary services 

 

Farmers reported PPR and FMD as common diseases in the Bekaa, Akkar and Hermel areas, which 
peak in April and November. Most of these farmers used to get vaccines from Syria free of charge, 
but now that source has dried up. Recently, Lebanon officially reported LSD to the World Animal 
Health Organization. Weak veterinary services in the aforementioned areas is of alarm. Small-scale 
dairy farmers from Bekaa reported that veterinarians used to respond to their call on payment for 
service, but now they are not coming at all. Farmers have requested basic training in animal health so 
they can address their problems themselves. All animals that have crossed into Lebanon are 
negatively affected by the lack of veterinary services. Strengthening animal health service, 
surveillance, diagnosis and control of TADs is urgently needed. 

 

Impacts on animal feeds 

 

High feed prices and pressure on grazing/rangelands is forcing Lebanese farmers out of business. 
Some 12 000 mountain and Shami goats are believed to have crossed into North Lebanon from Syria 
and settled, grazing on the Lebanese pastures and rangelands. The farmers, including the Lebanese 
returnees, used to benefit from feed subsidies from Syria. Lebanese agropastoralists in the border 
areas used to farm and get subsidized feeds and free vaccines from Syria, which are no longer 
available. All animals that have crossed into Lebanon are negatively affected by high feed prices. 
Animal feed and vaccines are immediate needs for livestock-keeping communities in border areas in 
Lebanon. 

 

Impacts on animal products 

 

Traditional dairy products, particularly laban and labneh, are the most popular protein sources in the 
Lebanese diet and accompany daily meals, providing people with high quality protein, especially 
children and women. White cheese used to be imported from Syria, but now Lebanon has resorted to 
buying more expensive products from Egypt. FAO has a successful project for the recovery and 
rehabilitation of the dairy subsector in the Bekaa Valley and Hermel-Akkar Uplands, which could be 
scaled up to reach more affected farmers. The project has a management unit in place, which has 
already undertaken a preliminary survey of Lebanese returnees and host communities with the aim of 
extending the project to implement a more of demand-driven, community-based and participatory 
value chain approach to the recovery and rehabilitation of their livelihoods. 

 

 

 


4. Turkey 

 

Turkish farmers bordering Syria are mostly raising sheep, goats and dairy and beef cattle. The cattle 
production system varies from highly commercialized farms to smallholder dairy units of less than 
ten cows. The beef cattle, sheep and goats are raised mainly in traditional farms in the east and 
southeast of Turkey. The overall trend of red meat production is declining due to high feed prices and 
restrictions in accessing pasture on common land. The Government provides subsidies through 
controlling feed prices and zero duty on imports of breeding stock to sustain the market. 

 

Animal movements and trade 

 

Family-run mixed farms on the Syrian border have reported concerns over the decreasing price of 
their animals and the increasing price of animal feeds. Poor Turkish farmers are not sure if the trend 
has any link to the incursion of Syrian animals. Such farmers need special assistance in terms of 
adopting good agricultural practices and resource use in order to maximize their benefits and keep 
their farm businesses running. 

 

Biosecurity and animal health threats 

 

The increased threat of TADs and zoonoses is the main concern for Turkish authorities and farmers. 
Illegal animal movements are largely controlled, though not fully due to the long (911 km) border 
shared with Syria. Animals are crossing into Turkey, with cases of PPR, bovine tuberculosis and 
brucellosis reportedly confirmed in captured animals. Thirteen cases of rabies have been reported in 
Gaziantep Province alone, which had not been seen before. In Turkey, all animals are identified by ear 
tags. Any captured animals without identification numbers are subject to immediate investigation, 
quarantine for 20 days and slaughter after the necessary testing for disease and legal judiciary 
decisions. Proceeds from the sale of healthy meat go to the treasury for funding of customs. Turkey 
has a very good and active disease surveillance system in place. The border with Syria is largely 
controlled; border police report to veterinary authorities when any illegal animal crosses into Turkish 
territory. Veterinary authorities in Gaziantep Province have reported cases of PPR and brucellosis, as 
well as malnourishment in animals crossing from Syria. 

 

There are alleged reports that cutaneous leishmaniasis is a growing threat in the refugee camps of 
Turkey. It should be noted that areas surrounding Aleppo are breeding ground for sand flies with a 
high number of cases reported by migrants from Aleppo in Tartous and in the Hassakeh camp for 
internally displaced people in Syria.

Funds requested 

USD 14 218 600 

Rationale and justification: 

Syrian veterinary services and animal vaccination programmes have collapsed over the past 6 to 
12 months, and the „number one. threat to the agriculture sector of the region is the spread of TADs 
from Syria to neighbouring countries. A significant number of cases of bluetongue, bovine 
tuberculosis, brucellosis, cutaneous leishmania, FMD, HPAI, LSD, PPR and rabies, have already been 
identified along the Syrian border in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and/or Turkey at higher than normal levels. 
April and November are the peak months for outbreaks of such TADs. Veterinary services in Iraq and 
Lebanon are weak, in Jordan they are inconsistent (but weak in border areas), and in Turkey they are 
effective (having received European Union support over the past decade) – to address such threats. In 
Egypt, FAO has a fully operational TAD control programme supporting the Government.s veterinary 
services. This could be scaled up to meet the new challenges of the Syria crisis. 

Expected outcome: 

Significant reduction in the threat of TAD outbreaks originating from Syria in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon 
and Turkey. 

Expected results: 

. An effective emergency response to any outbreak of TADs in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and 
Turkey. 
. Prevention of TAD outbreaks in the region through improved surveillance systems in Iraq, Jordan 
and Lebanon. 
. More efficient and effective regional coordination and networking systems for the monitoring and 
reporting of TADs (including the re-establishment of a Regional Centre for Animal Health). 
. Increased regional and national capacity for the control of TADs and zoonoses in the Near East. 


Key activities: 

(i) Support to the emergency response to TADs 

. Build the capacity of national public and private veterinary services for emergency response 
(i.e. preparedness, development of response plans, ensuring rapid response to TAD threats and 
assistance in resource mobilization in the case of emergencies such as the Syria crisis). 
. Provide technical and financial assistance to national veterinary services from Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, 





Lebanon and Turkey for the effective control of TADs through vaccination campaigns along Syria 
border areas, as required and in a timely manner. 
. Provide multidisciplinary training specifically designed to support overall regional resilience to 
significant TAD threats that could jeopardize regional and global agri-food trade. 


 

(ii) Support to the prevention of TADs 

. Strengthen surveillance mechanisms for outbreaks of TADs in the Syrian border areas through 
improved diagnostics and reporting of disease outbreaks, including the collection of samples and 
their submission to the nearest diagnostic laboratories, and epidemiological investigation of any 
reported outbreaks. 
. Promote and adopt the most effective, practical and regionally sustainable tools and systems for the 
prevention, early warning and horizon scanning of potential TAD threats (e.g. diagnostic 
laboratories, surveillance networks, quarantine facilities and slaughterhouses). 
. Ensure enabling and coherent national legislative structures across the animal food chain and 
related commercial operations. 


 

(iii) Regional coordination and networking 

. Re-establish a Regional Centre for Animal Health16 (as an integral part of FAO.s global ECTAD 
network) in a country of the region with accredited reference laboratories for TAD diagnostics and 
rapid air transport links, through provision of technical and financial support to the veterinary 
service of that host country. 
. Assist in regional coordination of existing and new networks for surveillance, prevention, 
detection, diagnostics and control of emerging TAD threats in Syrian border areas and beyond, and 
other high impact issues, according priorities of the region (as determined by the FAO/OIE Global 
Framework for TADs and the proposed Regional Centre for Animal Health). 
. Facilitate networking and exchange of data and technical information among the countries 
bordering Syria and in the region as a whole, including partnership and collaboration among 
national and international animal health bodies and institutions. 
. Assist national veterinary services of Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey in effective and 
coordinated multisectoral management of regional priorities in animal health and TAD control. 


 

(iv) Support to the capacity development of regional TAD control 

. Provide assistance to the Governments of Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey to support 
communication and public awareness capacity, and the formulation and implementation of TAD 
risk communication strategies for the Syrian border areas and beyond. 
. Provide scientific advice and technical assistance to national animal health organizations with 
specific needs for developing policies. 
. Provide training to build effective national and regional response to animal health threats from 
Syria in an integrated manner.

Rationale and justification: 

Syrian phytosanitary and food safety control services have collapsed over the past 6 to 12 months. There 
has been an increase in informal trade (smuggling) of food and agricultural commodities across borders 
with Syria in Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon following the crisis in Syria. There have also been significant 
changes in agricultural trading routes throughout the region. All of these developments have increased 
the risk of trading food at substandard quality, and the threat of transboundary plant diseases and pests 
accompanying the moving commodities – given the weak food safety and phytosanitary inspection 
systems in these countries, particularly at existing border crossings and especially at the new border 
crossings. 

FAO proposes to build on its recently completed “Strengthening Production and Marketing of Lebanese 
Agricultural Products Project”, which provided support for food inspection services at the ports of entry 
in Lebanon. The proposed project will focus primarily on Jordan and Lebanon but, funds permitting, it 
could be extended to Iraq where similar problems exist at its border crossings with Syria. However, all 
neighbouring countries affected by the Syria crisis will benefit from knowledge sharing under the project. 

Expected outcome: 

Import/export food inspection and certification systems strengthened in Jordan and Lebanon to manage 
the threat of transboundary crop diseases and pests, and contaminated and unsafe foodstuffs. 

Expected results: 

. The handling of food import control in the countries is based on the analysis of food risks. 
. Risk-based food control is reinforced. 
. Border food inspectors are trained in the risk-based control systems. 
. Phytosanitary capacity and infrastructure for the inspection and control of transboundary crop 
diseases and pests are strengthened. 
. Phytosanitary capacity for post-entry regulation measures and treatments is improved. 
. Laboratory facilities are strengthened, and staff associated with border food control and 
phytosanitary control is trained. 


Key activities: 

. Improve systems of food import control and guidance on the further expansion of this system as 
required. 
. Strengthen national food control laboratory capabilities, through the provision of equipment and 
training, covering both microbiological and chemical analysis. 
. Train 40 managers and technicians on import food inspection (20 from each country). 





. Increase communication among stakeholders (e.g. food control regulatory authorities, consumers 
and the food industry), including knowledge sharing with food inspection services of Iraq, Jordan, 
Lebanon, Syria and Turkey. 
. Conduct a phytosanitary capacity evaluation of the national plant quarantine services to identify 
weaknesses that need to be addressed through institutional strengthening. 
. Train plant quarantine officers and inspectors in the application of the International Standards for 
Phytosanitary Measures. 
. Improve the infrastructure and facilities of the post-entry phytosanitary stations in each country. 
. Strengthen the laboratories at the central administrations for plant quarantine and plant quarantine 
stations at the entry points with the necessary equipment and material for disease and pest 
inspection and recognition/diagnosis. 
. Strengthen the early warning and rapid response capabilities for transboundary pests and diseases. 
. Formulate a project proposal for consideration by governments and development partners for the 
further development of national food control systems across the Near East Region.

To reduce household-level food expenditures for vulnerable host communities 
and refugees 

Beneficiaries 

Some 2 500 poor Egyptian households in urban and peri-urban host 
communities and Syrian refugees

Starting date 

April 2013 (subject to the availability of funds) 

Funds requested 

USD 440 000 

Rationale and justification: 

The crisis in Syria has generated a large number of so-called „urban-refugees. scattered through Egypt, 
primarily in Cairo, Damietta, Alexandria and Port Said. Urban poverty is already high in Egypt and 
tends to be fuelled by people migrating towards the cities in an attempt to escape the deprivations 
associated with rural livelihoods. While urban food insecurity and its related problems should have 
already been placed high on the agenda of humanitarian and development actors, the influx of refugees 
is further underscoring the critical need to increase food production among the poorest urban dwellers, 
particularly those living in households headed by women. The scope of the proposed intervention 
builds on successful experiences in Egypt and neighbouring countries as well as on the global “Food 
for the Cities” network of experts led by FAO. The project will provide fresh, diversified and healthy 
food to Egyptian families that are supporting Syrian refugees, as well as refugees themselves. It will 
also further strengthen cohesion and solidarity between communities. 

Expected outcome: 

Enhanced food availability and dietary diversity at household level in urban and peri-urban settings by 
growing fresh and healthy food in small spaces, such as patios, terraces, rooftops and backyards. 

Expected results: 

. A minimum of 500 small urban farming production units are established by the end of the project. 
. Some 2 000 households (at least half headed by women), including host families and refugees, are 
accessing free, fresh and healthy food within three months of production unit establishment. 
. Efficient and sustainable use of natural resources (water in particular). 
. Gender equality promoted. 


Key activities: 

. Identification of beneficiaries, in partnership with UNHCR and implementing partners. 
. Response design tailored to the space available and families. preferences. 
. Preparation of bills of quantities and procurement of inputs (for backyard garden, aquaponics, 
small animal units, etc.). 
. Training of some 500 beneficiaries and technical support to set up production units. 
. Technical supervision throughout project implementation and maintenance of production units. 
. Project review and lessons learning documentation.

Rationale and justification: 

The crisis in Syria has generated a large number of so-called „urban-refugees. scattered through Egypt 
primarily in Cairo, Damietta, Alexandria and Port Said. Urban poverty is already high in Egypt and 
tends to be fuelled by people migrating towards the cities in an attempt to escape the deprivations 
associated with rural livelihoods. While urban food insecurity and its related problems should have 
already been placed high on the agenda of humanitarian and development actors, the influx of refugees 
is further underscoring the critical need to improve nutrition and increase income opportunities for the 
poorest urban dwellers, particularly those living in households headed by women. 

Syrians have brought a tradition of milk processing, sweets manufacturing, baking, etc. to Egypt, and 
such skills need to be developed and transferred to the poorest of urban dwellers, particularly among 
women-headed households. For example, entrepreneurial Syrians have already established small milk 
processing ventures in the Cairo suburb of 6th of October, as well as a number of other food processing 
activities. Refugees are also competing for employment opportunities, and income-generating activities 
are scarce. Some refugees are therefore opening small businesses in the area of food services and 
processing, including restaurants and small-scale dairy processing. 

FAO proposes to build on the experiences of its ongoing Government of Italy-funded project, 
“Improving Household Food and Nutrition Security in Egypt by Targeting Women and Youth” to 
enhance the capacity of refugees and host communities to benefit from the skills and experience of 
Syrian refugees, as well as to generate income and increase the availability of high quality and 
nutritious food in communities of greater Cairo where refugees reside. In this context, the project aims 
to provide fresh, diversified and healthy food to poor Egyptian families that are supporting Syrian 
refugees, as well as to refugees themselves, while strengthening cohesion and solidarity between 
communities. 

Expected outcome: 

Enhanced nutritional status and income-generating capacity of Syrian refugees and poor peri-urban 
communities hosting Syrian refugees. 

Expected results: 

. Improved access to diversified food intake and supplementary income among poor Egyptian 
households and Syrian refugees (particularly women) through the promotion of homestead and 
community-based food processing and marketing. 
. Improved quality and safety of food available in markets for Syrian refugee families, poor Egyptian 
communities hosting these refugees and the general population. 
. Food nutrition and health behaviour improved among some 2 000 Syrian refugee households and 
poor Egyptian households living in the same communities as refugees. 





. Capacities built and integrated, and participatory approaches for improving food and nutrition 
security in Syrian refugee community centres institutionalized by stakeholders. 


Key activities: 

. Conduct rapid needs assessments and identify beneficiaries or groups of beneficiaries (particularly 
women and youth), in partnership with local NGOs and CBOs. 
. Undertake simple feasibility studies and prepare basic business plans for project beneficiaries (i.e. 
individual households or groups of five to ten families) to grade, process, package, store and/or 
market fruit, vegetable, dairy, egg and meat products. 
. Provide the necessary and appropriate food grading, processing, packaging, storage and marketing 
equipment and materials to beneficiary households or groups of beneficiary households. 
. Identify and support women and youth willing and ready to engage in setting up hygienic food-
based retail shops in poor urban communities where Syrian refugees are residing. 
. Train project beneficiaries who want to establish ad hoc “producer marketing groups” in group 
formation and management, produce marketing systems, etc. (training will be tailored to use the 
skills and experience of Syrian refugees and to transfer these to Egyptians). 
. Develop and implement food nutrition and health education strategies for poor Egyptians and 
Syrian refugees through visual aids, local media messages, focus group meetings, etc. 
. Train project beneficiaries in food handling, preparation and hygiene, grading of agricultural 
produce, and processing, packaging and storage of fruit, vegetable, dairy, egg and meat-based 
commodities through participatory and group-based approaches, such as farmer business schools. 
. Train government and NGO extension staff/technicians/mobilizers in group-based participatory 
extension approaches (e.g. farmer business schools), group dynamics and administration, good 
agricultural practices, post-harvest management and food and nutrition security/behaviour. 
. Develop participatory value chains for quality fruit, vegetable, dairy, egg and meat commodities 
(e.g. market information, packing and transportation) with local wholesalers, retailers, processors, 
etc.

Effective control of TADs along the Syrian border areas of Ninawa Governorate 
through improved delivery of animal health services and animal disease 
surveillance, diagnosis, reporting and early warning systems 

Beneficiaries 

Community, public and private animal health services of Ninawa Governorate,

Two years 

Starting date 

April 2013 (subject to the availability of funds) 

Funds requested 

USD 4 401 750 

Rationale and justification: 

Ninawa Governorate in Iraq is home to 1.25 million sheep and 150 000 goats. The livestock-keeping 
Bedouins from the Syrian border areas of Iraq move their sheep and goats to Syria during the winter 
season and move them back to Iraq during the summer season. This (Hema) transhumance grazing 
system has been disrupted due to the crisis in Syria. In addition, Syrian veterinary services (i.e. disease 
surveillance and diagnosis, and vaccination programmes) have collapsed over the past 6 to 12 months. 
Unvaccinated Syrian sheep and goats are now crossing into Iraq. PPR and FMD are the most feared 
TADs in Ninawa Governorate. Although major efforts have been made by the Government of Iraq to 
develop specific disease control strategies, too little attention has been given to improve animal health 
delivery at the community level in such remote areas. Disease control is hampered by low incomes; 
inaccessibility of veterinary services; lack of animal health skills, knowledge and interest in disease 
surveillance and reporting; and the absence of trained auxiliaries. The field veterinary services are 
constrained by the lack of adequate human and logistic resources. 

The lack of animal health services in these marginal areas, as well as high animal feed prices, have 
seriously affected Iraqi livestock herders and many are now selling their animals at much reduced 
prices. FAO proposes an additional component for the ongoing United Nations Development 
Group/Iraq Trust Fund-funded and FAO-implemented project “Develop the Performance of Small 
Ruminants (Sheep and Goats) and Improve the Level of Income for Small Breeders” in Ninawa 
Governorate, building on a project management unit which is already in place. The new component 
will therefore focus on the much-needed upgrading of disease surveillance and diagnostic capacity, 
veterinary quarantine facilities, and emergency vaccination campaigns against priority TADs, along 
with the capacity development of field veterinarians and community animal health workers (CAHWs). 

Expected outcome: 

Significant reduction in the threat of outbreaks of TADs and zoonoses originating from Syria in 
Ninawa Governorate of Iraq and improved livelihoods of host communities and Bedouin herders 
through increased animal production, food nutrition and household income. 

Expected results: 

. Veterinary and livestock extension services developed and functioning at the community level in 
remote areas along the Syrian border. 
. Improved veterinary skills of private and public veterinarians in the target rural areas. 
. Better equipped veterinary quarantine and operational facilities for veterinarians in the field 
veterinary clinics. 
. Improved, proper and timely communication of risks and outbreaks for rapid containment and 





disease control programmes. 
. Sheep, goats (and cattle) vaccinated against important serotypes of FMD and PPR. 
. Improved epidemio-surveillance, reporting by communities, diagnosis and post-vaccination 
monitoring of FMD and PPR for progressive control pathway contributing to disease freedom for 
the Governorate. 
. Increased public awareness and informed decision-making capacity at farm and community levels 
on TAD control in general and zoonotic diseases in particular. 
. Defined roles and responsibilities of private and public veterinary services based on a socio-
economic analysis for direct and indirect costs for optimizing efficiency and impacts. 


Key activities: 

. Develop the capacity of field veterinarians and CAHWs in the remote areas of Ninawa 
Governorate. 
. Conduct institutional assessment of veterinary quarantine systems and facilities in Ninawa 
Governorate. 
. Provide essential equipment and materials required to improve veterinary quarantine, field 
veterinary clinics and cold chains, including veterinary kits, drugs and vaccines. 
. Train veterinarians in animal disease surveillance, reporting, import risk assessment, veterinary 
quarantine, early warning and reporting for timely communication of TAD risks for preparedness 
and rapid containment of disease outbreaks. 
. Conduct mass vaccination campaigns against FMD and PPR, and other priority diseases. 
. Organize public awareness raising workshops at community level on TADs and zoonoses. 
. Provide technical support on legislation and policy advice on the roles and responsibilities of 
private and public veterinary services. 
. Conduct socio-economic analysis of the intervention, including cost-benefit analysis.

Funds requested 

USD 3 124 000 

Rationale and justification: 

The large number of refugees in the Kurdish Region of Iraq has created competition for labour as well 
as increased pressure on local food production. The agriculture sector in the Kurdish Region had been 
declining in recent times and has been identified by both the Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan 
Regional Government as an important area for rehabilitation and development. Syrian refugees have 
come from a mix of urban and rural areas, a number of whom have agricultural backgrounds in various 
types of cereal crop and vegetable farming. Kurdish populations have become increasingly urbanized 
due to lack of investment in the agriculture sector and perceived opportunities. Additionally, while 
70 percent of the population lives in urban areas, food insecurity and poverty are disproportionately 
concentrated in rural areas, where two-thirds of food insecure people are located. The effects of the 
influx of large numbers of refugees will be felt the most by those who are already vulnerable to food 
insecurity and poverty. 

FAO proposes to build on the recently completed Government of Australia-funded and FAO-
implemented “Emergency Support Project to Food Insecure Rural Households through Establishing 
Home Gardens in Iraq”, and the United Nations Development Group/Iraq Trust Fund-funded and FAO-
implemented “Community Livelihoods and Micro-industry Support Project in Rural and Urban Areas 
of Northern Iraq” to enhance food production and income-generating opportunities among these 
vulnerable Kurdish rural households as well as the Syrian refugees that they are hosting. 

Expected outcome: 

Reduced food and nutrition insecurity and increased incomes generated by vulnerable rural households 
(including smallholder and marginal farmers, agricultural wage earners and Syrian refugees). 

Expected results: 

. Increased domestic food production by 3 500 vulnerable rural households from communities hosting 
Syrian refugees in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. 
. Increased income-generating opportunities for 1 000 vulnerable rural households from communities 
hosting Syrian refugees in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, particularly women, through the expansion 
of agricultural micro-industries. 
. Capacities built and integrated, and participatory approaches for improving food and nutrition 
security institutionalized by stakeholders, such as the Dohuk, Sulamaniya and Erbil Directorates of 
Agriculture, local NGOs and farmers. associations. 


Key activities: 

. Conduct rapid needs assessments and identify beneficiaries in partnership with local NGOs and 
CBOs. 
. Develop curricula and training materials for increasing smallholder agricultural production in 





project areas through participatory extension approaches. 
. Train 50 master trainers and FFS/FBS facilitators to implement farmer field schools (FFSs) and 
farmer business schools (FBSs). 
. Implement 120 FFSs to promote and transfer new and improved crop production technologies and 
practices (e.g. for cereals, legumes and vegetables), including integrated pest management, on-farm 
water management and conservation agriculture. 
. Provide farm tools and machinery and agricultural inputs required to support FFSs and their 
participants, and develop revolving funds where applicable. 
. Confirm the type of micro-industries applicable to the project.s target beneficiaries, and develop/ 
replicate curricula and training materials (from FAO.s recently completed “Community Livelihoods 
and Micro-industry Support Project in Rural and Urban Areas of Northern Iraq”). 
. Identify women willing and ready to engage in agricultural micro-industries, such as post-harvest 
handling and storage of fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as dairy, fruit and honey processing. 
. Implement 40 FBSs where women farmers learn food processing, packaging and storage, 
produce marketing, basic business management, micro-financing, etc. 
. Provide agroprocessing equipment and materials necessary to establish household-based enterprises 
and community-based producer marketing groups, and develop revolving funds where applicable. 
. Develop value chains (i.e. input supply and produce marketing linkages) to support men and women 
farmers. groups evolving from FFSs and FBSs. 
. Provide technical support and carry out project monitoring and backstopping, including 
implementation of any corrective measures.

Funds requested 

USD 2 068 000 

Rationale and justification: 

The livestock-keeping Bedouins from the Syrian border areas of northern Jordan move their sheep and 
goats to Syria during the winter season and move them back to Jordan during the summer season. This 
transhumance grazing system of the Badia rangelands has been disrupted due to the crisis in Syria. 
In addition, Syrian veterinary services (i.e. disease surveillance and diagnosis, and vaccination 
programmes) have collapsed over the past 6 to 12 months. Unvaccinated Syrian animals are now 
crossing into Jordan. It is important to note that FMD, PPR, bluetongue, brucellosis, LSD and HPAI 
have all been unofficially reported in the Syrian border areas of Jordan at higher than normal levels. 
Jordan does not undertake TAD surveillance and reporting, and its nearest quarantine facility is 35 km 
from the Syrian border, which does not comply with minimum international biosecurity standards. 

The disruption of field veterinary services, disease surveillance, diagnosis and vaccination programmes 
in Syria has serious implications for Jordanian livestock. PPR, FMD (particularly the SAT2 strain) and 
LSD are the TADs most feared by Jordanian farmers. Smallholder sheep- and goat-keeping 
communities in the marginal areas bordering Syria are the most vulnerable groups. The lack of animal 
health services in these areas, as well as high animal feed prices, have seriously affected Jordanian 
livestock farmers and many are now selling their animals at much reduced prices. Although significant 
efforts have been made by the Government of Jordan to support sheep- and goat-keeping communities 
through feed subsidies and vaccination programmes, the capacity to cope with the increased threat of 
TADs from unvaccinated livestock crossing into Jordan is limited. On the whole, the animal health 
service delivery at community level in the remote border areas, national disease surveillance, 
monitoring and reporting, and animal quarantine systems are not up to the standard required to address 
the increasing threat of TADs. Field veterinary services are constrained by the lack of adequate human 
and logistic resources. 

Expected outcome: 

Significant reduction in the threat of outbreaks of TADs and zoonoses originating from Syria in 
northern governorates of Jordan and improved livelihoods of host communities and livestock herders 
through increased animal production, food nutrition and household income. 

Expected results: 

. Improved veterinary and livestock extension services at the community level in remote areas along 
the Syrian border.

To restore the agricultural livelihoods of rural communities hosting Syrian 
refugees through enhanced rangeland and post-harvest management 

Beneficiaries 

Some 5 000 poor and vulnerable smallholder households living in rural

Funds requested 

USD 5 065 500 

Rationale and justification: 

The Government of Jordan has recently completed a poverty assessment and mapping exercise for the 
country. Moreover, WFP has recently launched a USD 26 million protracted relief and recovery 
(PRRO) project that will target „poverty pockets. of Jordan with demand-driven and community-based 
“food assistance for assets” interventions. Several poverty pockets have been identified in the northern 
border areas with Syria. These same communities are now hosting the majority of Syrian refugees 
outside of the Zaatari Refugee Camp. There is now an urgent need to restore the agricultural 
livelihoods of these host communities through, for example, household and community-based income-
generation initiatives, such as the rehabilitation of degraded rangelands (i.e. through food- and cash-
for-work and provision of agricultural inputs). 

The Badia rangelands of northern Jordan, northwestern Iraq and southern Syria provide traditional 
grazing lands to herders who migrate with their sheep and goats in search of seasonal animal feeds and 
water. Increasing animal populations and the increased frequency and intensity of droughts have meant 
that, even before the Syria crisis, rangelands were being overgrazed, land was being degraded and the 
semi-desert steppes were being reduced to non-productive deserts. With the insecurity in Syria and the 
increased threat of TADs, Bedouin herders and livestock keepers are now concentrating on the margins 
of the Badia rangelands in northern Jordan and northwestern Iraq – and placing additional pressure on 
both Jordan.s fragile natural resource base and the impoverished socio-economic situation of many 
host communities to Syrian refugees in these areas. 

The Government of Jordan.s Ministry of Agriculture and WFP have subsequently requested FAO to 
mobilize resources and provide technical and financial assistance to support the new two-year PRRO 
project with interventions specifically targeted at host communities of Syrian refugees in northern Jordan. 

Expected outcome (shared with WFP/PRRO): 

Restoration of the agricultural livelihoods of food insecure and vulnerable smallholder farming 
families from rural communities hosting Syrian refugees through enhanced rangeland and post-harvest 
management income-generating initiatives. 

Expected results: 

. Income generated by 4 00017 households through community works to restore community assets 
and natural resources. 
. Income generated and sustained by 1 000 farming families through post-harvest management 
initiatives, such as food processing, packaging and marketing.

interventions (i.e. 100 staff of public and private service providers, 300 representatives of farmers. 
groups, and male and female beneficiary farmers). 


Key activities: 

. Conduct rapid needs assessments and identify beneficiaries in partnership with UNHCR, WFP, 
and local NGOs and CBOs. 
. Design, provide technical assistance and agricultural inputs, and supervise community works to 
restore community assets and natural resources in the Badia rangelands (e.g. water-harvesting 
structures and seeding/planting of appropriate grasses and shrubs for rangeland improvement). 
. Design, provide technical assistance and agricultural inputs, and supervise agroforestry subprojects 
(e.g. fruit tree planting, de-rocking and terracing, rehabilitation of small-scale irrigation systems 
and integrated homestead farming in more fertile valley bottoms).

household and community-based food processing, packaging and marketing subprojects (e.g. fruit, 
vegetables, eggs and milk products). 
. Transfer new and improved production and post-harvest technologies and practices, and group 
administration to male and female beneficiary farmers through the implementation of farmer field 
schools (including rangeland management, animal husbandry, water management, fodder 
production, integrated homestead gardening, and food processing, storage and marketing). 
. Train public and private service providers in group-based participatory extension approaches 
(e.g. farmer field schools), group dynamics and administration, community-based rangeland

USD 4 285 000 

Rationale and justification: 

The Syria crisis has transformed a number of seasonal Syrian migrant workers into longer-term destitute 
refugees. At the same time, a number of farmers in the Jordan Valley who used to employ Syrian 
labourers have now become host families. Jordanian farmers are already facing significant challenges in 
relation to the viability of their enterprises. Indeed, increasing production costs and endemic pests, such as 
tomato leaf miner (Tuta absoluta), wheat rust and fruit flies are compounding the difficulties of 
smallholder farming families to make a living. The economic cost of Syrian refugees is further 
exacerbating the vulnerability of Jordanian farming communities. However, the influx of refugees could 
also represent a market opportunity for Jordanian farmers; increasing access to fresh, nutritious and 
affordable products particularly in camps and host community centres should be encouraged. 

FAO proposes to extend its recently launched project, “Management of Tomato Borer: Tuta Absoluta in 
the Near East Region” and its recently completed Government of Italy-funded and FAO-implemented 
“Regional Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Programme in the Near East” to focus on: (i) reducing 
the prevalence of fruit and vegetable pests (particularly fruit flies and Tuta absoluta) in production 
areas hosting and employing Syrian refugees; and (ii) increasing the availability of and access to fresh, 
nutritious and affordable vegetables in refugee camps and community centres in Jordan. 

Expected outcome: 

Improved smallholder fruit and vegetable protection in Jordan for the sale of quality, nutritious and 
affordable produce to Syrian refugee camps and host communities through environmentally sustainable 
IPM and low-cost and financially viable value-chain approaches. 

Expected results: 

. Reduced prevalence of fruit and vegetable pests (particularly fruit flies and Tuta absoluta) in 
smallholder farming areas of Jordan hosting and employing Syrian refugees. 
. Capacity of some 2 000 Jordanian small-scale farming households to employ an equal number of 
seasonal Syrian workers preserved. 
. Increased availability of and access to fresh, nutritious and affordable vegetables in Syrian refugee 
camps and community centres in Jordan. 
. Income-generation opportunities created at Syrian refugee camps and community centres (with 
focus on a minimum of 300 women), through the establishment of retail shops for the sale of quality 
fruit and vegetables and other nutritious foodstuffs. 


Key activities: 

. Conduct rapid needs assessments and identify beneficiaries in partnership with local NGOs and CBOs. 
. Scale up IPM in the Jordan Valley and other areas with high concentration of smallholder fruit and 





vegetable farmers through the procurement and distribution of mass trapping equipment, double-
door systems, etc. 
. Train 50 master trainers and farmer field school (FFS) facilitators to implement FFSs focused on 
IPM. 
. Implement 200 FFSs to promote and transfer new and improved IPM technologies and practices. 
. Develop supply chains of quality fruit and vegetables to refugee camps and community centres 
(market information, packing, transportation, etc.). 
. Implement 12 farmer business schools within existing cooperatives or ad hoc farmers. groups to 
train farmers in produce marketing, basic business management, etc. 
. Identify women willing and ready to engage in setting up fruit and vegetable retail shops in refugee 
camps and community centres. 
. Provide equipment and materials necessary to establish small sales points for quality fruit and 
vegetables. 
. Provide technical support and conduct project monitoring and backstopping, including 
implementation of any corrective measures.

Objective 

To introduce small-scale household and community-based food processing 
facilities in Zaatari Refugee Camp and host communities in the Syrian border 
areas of Jordan 

Beneficiaries 

500 Syrian refugee households living in Zaatari Refugee Camp and community 
centres along the Syrian border directly benefiting from increased income; and 
3 000 refugee households indirectly benefiting from improved food nutrition

Starting date 

April 2013 (subject to the availability of funds) 

Funds requested 

USD 616 000 

Rationale and justification: 

Zaatari Refugee Camp is host to over 100 000 Syrian refugees. As the camp is beyond capacity, living 
conditions inside are very difficult. Access to food in the required amounts and variety for a complete 
diet are lacking, and protein sources are becoming more difficult to access. The ability to purchase 
these items are restricted by a lack of income-generating opportunities in which Syrian refugees can 
engage, due to restrictions on entering and exiting the camp, as well as the space available – meaning 
that kitchen gardening and small livestock production are not an option. Livelihood options inside the 
camp (as well as in Syrian refugee community centres outside of the camp) are limited to the trading of 
items needed in the camp/centres (including poor quality fresh fruit and vegetables, and frozen and 
fresh meats). Some small-scale food processing activities take place in the camp, despite these barriers, 
and this can be improved and expanded to a limited number of refugees. 

Communities hosting Syrians in villages bordering Syria are practicing mixed farming (i.e. cereals, 
fruits, vegetables, dairy, sheep and backyard poultry production). Increased agricultural input costs (in 
particular, animal feed) have made production inputs unaffordable to small-scale producers. Numerous 
constraints are sending smallholders out of business, including insufficient of resources, lack of 
appropriate skills for adding value to crop and animal products (especially vegetables and dairy) and 
less competitive returns for their produce (as they are unable to access better markets). There is an 
urgent need to support host communities in developing their skills and good agricultural practices 
through introducing new and improved hygienic food processing technologies, as well as grading, 
packaging and marketing systems. Provision of simple household and community-based food 
processing equipment and materials would improve household nutrition and income. 

Expected outcome: 

Enhanced wellbeing (i.e. food, nutrition, income, etc.) of Syrian refugee families living in Zaatari 
Refugee Camp and community centres, and Jordanian farming families from those host communities in 
the border areas of Jordan. 

Expected results: 

. Improved income-generating opportunities for 500 Syrian refugee households and Jordanian 
smallholder farming families (from host communities), through the adoption of new food processing 
and marketing technologies and practices. 
. Reduced malnutrition among 3 000 Syrian refugee households and Jordanian smallholder farming 
households (from host communities), through improved access to quality, safe and nutritious foods 
(e.g. vegetables, fruits, dairy products, eggs and fresh meat). 





Key activities: 

. Conduct rapid needs assessments and identify beneficiaries or groups of beneficiaries (particularly 
women) in partnership with local NGOs and CBOs. 
. Undertake simple feasibility studies and prepare basic business plans for project beneficiaries 
(i.e. individual households, or groups of five to ten farming families) to grade, process, package, 
store and/or market fruit, vegetable, dairy, egg and meat products. 
. Provide the necessary and appropriate food grading, processing, packaging, storage and marketing 
equipment and materials to beneficiary households or groups of beneficiary households. 
. Identify and support women willing and ready to engage in setting up hygienic food-based retail 
shops in refugee camps and community centres. 
. Train project beneficiaries who want to establish ad hoc “producer marketing groups” in group 
formation and management, produce marketing systems, etc. 
. Develop and implement a food nutrition and health education strategy among target communities 
hosting Syrian refugees (i.e. visual aids, local media messages, focus group meetings, etc.) 
. Train project beneficiaries in food handling, preparation and hygiene, produce grading, and the 
processing, packaging and storage of fruit, vegetable, dairy, egg and meat-based commodities 
through participatory and group-based approaches, such as farmer business schools. 
. Train government and NGO extension staff/technicians/mobilizers in group-based participatory 
extension approaches (e.g. farmer business schools), group dynamics and administration, good 
agricultural practices, post-harvest management and food and nutrition security/behaviour. 
. Develop participatory value chains for quality fruit, vegetable, dairy, egg and meat commodities 
(i.e. market information, packing, transportation, etc.) with local wholesalers, retailers, processors, 
etc. – especially for smallholder Jordanian beneficiaries from host communities.

J5. Increased household egg production among host communities of Syrian 
refugees in the border areas of Jordan 

Objective 

Empowering communities hosting refugees in the Syrian border areas of northern 
Jordan to become small-scale poultry farmers for the reliable supply of eggs to 
local markets and improved food nutrition of producers and consumers 

Beneficiaries 

Some 2 000 impoverished farming households from Jordanian host 
communities, including women-headed households

Starting date 

April 2013 (subject to the availability of funds) 

Funds requested 

USD 1 100 000 

Rationale and justification: 

Half a century ago, Jordan was self-sufficient in poultry products, primarily coming from small-scale 
commercial poultry farms, and village or backyard free-range poultry units. Prior to the Syria crisis, 
Jordan was almost totally dependent on imports from Syria to meet its demand for eggs. Poultry 
production is the most affected agro-industry in Syria, with the total destruction of large poultry farms 
in areas such as Idleb, Homs and Rural Damascus. For a while, eggs were smuggled across the 
Jordanian border but, with the unavailability of day-old chicks, animal feed and animal health services, 
even this unofficial trade has dried up. It is estimated that the demand for eggs in Jordan will increase 
from 820 million in 2012 to 1.2 billion in 2013 with the increasing influx of Syrian refugees. Syrians 
traditionally consume eggs, and egg- and dairy-based products. The Ministry of Agriculture reported a 
shortfall of some 400 million eggs in 2012. 

In such a protracted crisis, the most affected and vulnerable groups are food and nutrition insecure host 
communities that are too economically poor to cope with the increased prices of foodstuffs, such as eggs. 
There is an urgent need to empower the host communities of northern Jordan to become small-scale farm 
businesses and increase/improve their food production, nutrition and income generation – becoming 
sustainable poultry farmers would be a cost-effective option that satisfies all criteria. The proposed 
project.s outputs include the reintroduction of village/household poultry production systems accompanied 
by improved poultry farming skills, enhanced family nutrition and improved household income 
opportunities, all linked to the development of stronger value chains through partnerships with private 
sector traders and processors. Stakeholders would therefore be encouraged to upscale egg production 
strategies from one of self-sufficiency, to the adequate and reliable supply of local markets in northern 
Jordan, to cooperative-based semi-commercial enterprises over time. 

Expected outcome: 

Reintroduction and enhancement of egg production and marketing among host communities to Syrian 
refugees in northern Jordan. 

Expected results: 

. Reintroduction of village/household poultry production systems, accompanied by improved poultry 
farming skills for some 2 000 households from Jordanian host communities. 
. Enhanced family nutrition through the increased consumption of poultry products, particularly fresh 
eggs. 
. Improved household income opportunities through the sale of eggs to ready markets. 
. Sustainable value chains for the supply of poultry inputs and marketing of eggs in/beyond the local 
markets. 





Key activities: 

. Conduct rapid needs assessments and identify host communities and beneficiaries in partnership 
with local NGOs and CBOs. 
. Conduct a rapid assessment of input supplies (i.e. chickens, feeds, medicines, etc.) and potential 
market outlets (i.e. local, provincial and national, including Syrian refugees). 
. Prepare business plans and estimate cash flow projections and capital requirements for individual 
sustainable village/household poultry units. 
. Provide sustainable poultry production packages (i.e. laying hens, cocks, bio-secure housing, 
feeders, drinkers and three months of chicken feed) to beneficiary groups or households. 
. Train beneficiary famers in good agricultural practices (i.e. housing and biosecurity, healthcare and 
feeding, egg collection and packaging, etc.). 
. Create successful and sustainable egg production enterprises (including leadership and oversight 
arrangements, group formation and cooperative development, housing design and construction, 
and marketing and business management). 
. Develop value chains for the supply of poultry inputs (including vaccination programmes) and 
marketing of eggs (surplus to household requirements) to local and eventually through regional 
and national outlets. 
. Establish egg producing cooperatives to sustain value chains (i.e. formation, training, business 
development, etc.).

Objective 

To prevent the spread of transboundary animal diseases (TADs) from Syria 
through targeted emergency vaccination campaigns and prevent the further loss 
of livestock assets by feeding Bedouin herds grazing on degraded rangelands in 
Syrian border areas of Lebanon 

Beneficiaries

Starting date 

April 2013 (subject to the availability of funds) 

Funds requested 

USD 5 214 000 

Rationale and justification: 

Animal health services collapsed in Syria during 2012. In Lebanon, livestock keepers and communities 
depending on livestock for their livelihoods are very concerned about the large influx of unvaccinated 
Syrian sheep, goats and dairy cattle as a result of the crisis in Syria. These animals are partly sold in 
Lebanon for one-third of their market price. Some of these animals have been taken by their buyers to 
various parts of Lebanon without quarantine and vaccination, increasing the threat of TADs. The two 
most prevalent diseases in the border areas are PPR and FMD, which tend to peak in the months of 
April and November. Veterinary services in Lebanon are practically non-existent, particularly in the 
border areas with Syria. Most farmers used to get vaccines from Syria free of charge, but now that 
source has disappeared. The Ministry of Agriculture needs support in surveillance, quarantine, 
vaccination and TAD control programmes. The Ministry has opened vacancies to recruit and train some 
200 veterinary surgeons, but this is too late for the present threats. 

On the other hand, high feed prices and pressure on seasonal pastures and rangelands are forcing 
Lebanese farmers out of business. Some 12 000 Syrian Mountain and Shami goats have crossed into 
northern Lebanon and settled – bringing the added threat of overgrazing, land degradation and potential 
desertification. Lebanese returnees used to benefit from Syria.s seasonal pastures and generous feed 
subsidies but, like the free vaccines, this source has disappeared. 

Expected outcome: 

Significant reduction in: (i) the threat of TADs and cases of FMD, PPR, etc. reported; and (ii) the 
number of animals dying, malnourished and being sold at reduced prices. 

Expected results: 

. Increased number of sheep, goats and cattle vaccinated against important serotypes of FMD and 
PPR. 
. Veterinary and livestock extension services developed and functioning at the community level in 
remote areas along the Syrian border. 
. Improved, proper and timely communication of risks and outbreaks for rapid containment and TAD 
control programmes. 
. Increased number of livestock keepers able to retain and make a living from their herds of sheep 
and goats and dairy cattle in the medium term. 


Key activities: 

. Initiate the development of a national strategy for TAD control through improved epidemio-





surveillance, reporting by communities, diagnosis and post-vaccination monitoring of FMD and 
PPR for a progressive control pathway. 
. Conduct rapid needs assessments and identify livestock keepers at risk due to TADs and animal 
malnutrition, in partnership with local government extension services, cooperatives and CBOs. 
. Undertake emergency vaccination campaigns of sheep, goats and cattle against FMD and PPR with 
appropriate types of vaccines. 
. Identify, train and equip community animal health workers to improve veterinary services at the 
community level in remote areas along the Syrian border. 
. Develop the capacity of community animal health workers and livestock keepers in disease 
identification and reporting for early outbreak investigation and rapid containment of TADs. 
. Humane slaughtering and correct disposal of animals confirmed as being infected with TADs (by 
veterinary surgeons registered with the Ministry of Agriculture). 
. Procure quality animal feeds and distribute to target beneficiaries through local NGOs and CBOs. 
. Implement farmer field schools to transfer new and improved animal health, animal feeding and 
pasture/rangeland management technologies and practices to targeted livestock keepers.

To restore the agricultural livelihoods of Lebanese returnees, rural communities 
hosting returnees and Syrian refugees through enhanced crop and livestock 
production and marketing 

Beneficiaries 

Some 6 000 poor and vulnerable Lebanese returnee households and their host

Starting date 

April 2013 (subject to the availability of funds) 

Funds requested 

USD 7 535 000 

Rationale and justification: 

It is estimated that the Syria crisis has affected 30 000 poor smallholder Lebanese returnees that have 
been farming inside Syria for generations, viz: (i) they have lost all of their assets (including houses, 
farm buildings, livestock, fruit trees, farm machinery and irrigation equipment); (ii), they, and their 
Lebanese relatives, are now obliged to host their former Syrian neighbours (many of whom are living in 
unsanitary tented accommodation); and (iii) they have lost access to subsidized Syrian agricultural 
inputs, such as fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, animal feed, vaccines and animal medicines, and the ability 
to generate income through cross-border trading in such goods. The highly vulnerable returnees are 
now hosted in some 136 villages of all districts bordering Syria, most of which represent the poorest 
population pockets of the country (e.g. Akkar, Baalbek, Hasbaya, Hermel and Marjaayoun) that were 
already the target of the Government of Lebanon.s social safety-net programmes prior to the Syria 
crisis. 

FAO proposes to extend its recently completed “Strengthening Production and Marketing of Lebanese 
Agricultural Products Project” and expand its ongoing “Recovery and Rehabilitation of the Dairy 
Sector in Bekaa Valley and Hermel-Akkar Uplands Project” and “Emergency Livelihoods Support for 
Vulnerable Lebanese who Fled from Syria to Lebanon Seeking Refuge and their Hosting Families 
Project” (where FAO project management units are already in place). The intervention aims to assist 
Lebanese returnees and their host families with demand-driven, community-based and participatory 
value chain approaches to agricultural livelihood recovery and rehabilitation – through the provision of 
agricultural livelihood packages (selected from a menu of proven and sustainable interventions) and 
appropriate training. 

Expected outcome: 

Improved food and nutrition security and enhanced income generation through restoring the 
agricultural livelihoods of poor and vulnerable returnee smallholder Lebanese farming families and 
their host communities residing in the border areas with Syria. 

Expected results (in line with ongoing FAO projects): 

. Reduced food insecurity of 5 000 affected farming households through increases in crop and 
livestock production. 
. Enhanced income generation of 1 000 affected farming households through increased opportunities 
in food processing, packaging, storage and marketing. 
. Improved food nutrition and food safety of 6 000 affected farming households through the 
increased consumption of fruit, vegetables and dairy produce and the adoption of more hygienic 
production and processing practices. 





. Capacities of stakeholders developed to financially and environmentally sustain the project.s 
interventions (i.e. 100 staff of public and private service providers, 250 representatives of farmers. 
groups, and male and female beneficiary farmers). 


Key activities (as validated by ongoing FAO projects): 

. Conduct rapid needs assessments and identify beneficiaries, in partnership with local NGOs and 
CBOs.

Region/Country 

Turkey 

Project name 

T1. Support to „micro-gardening. initiatives for improved food nutrition and 
income generation in selected Syrian refugee camps of Turkey 

Objective 

To improve the income-generation capacity and nutritional status of Syrian 
refugees 

Beneficiaries 

2 000 impoverished Syrian refugees with no opportunity to find seasonal work 
outside of refugee camps, particularly women and youth 

Implementing 
partners 

Kilis (and other) Provincial Directorates for Food, Agriculture and Livestock, 
AFAD and local NGOs 

Duration 

One year 

Starting date 

April 2013 (subject to the availability of funds) 

Funds requested 

USD 506 000 

Rationale and justification: 

The Government of Turkey has established 17 camps for Syrian refugees – which provide medical and 
educational services and three meals per day – and continues to construct new ones. There is 
insufficient space for refugees to operate kitchen gardens to grow vegetables and rear small livestock 
such as chickens and rabbits. However, there is evidence from some camps that refugees are growing 
vegetables and herbs in small containers around, or hanging from, their tents and containerized housing 
units. This is despite the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency of Turkey (AFAD) and the 
Turkish Red Crescent stating that there is no need for such food production, given the “three meals per 
day” policy and the risk of unhygienic conditions developing within the camps. 

However, the Provincial Government of Kilis has recently announced that all new Syrian refugee 
camps in its province will include areas designated for refugees to grow fruits, vegetables, herbs, etc. – 
more for reasons of occupational therapy than for the provision of added nutrients and vitamins to diets 
and small amounts of income generated from the sale of produce. FAO proposes to draw on its global 
experience of working with refugees in emergency situations and provide technical assistance to the 
Provincial Directorates for Food, Agriculture and Livestock, AFAD and local NGOs in the 
establishment of short-season „micro-gardens. within the limited space of refugee camps. The project 
also proposes to build the capacity of impoverished refugees (particularly women and youth) to 
generate income from the sale of produce grown in the gardens, while improving their nutritional status 
in the camps. 

Expected outcome: 

Enhanced nutritional status and income-generation capacity of impoverished Syrian refugees through 
support to „micro-gardening. initiatives in selected refugee camps. 

Expected results: 

. Some 2 000 refugee families (with a minimum of 50 percent as women-headed households) are 
accessing free, fresh and healthy food within three months of production unit establishment, and 
generating supplementary income from the sale of surplus production. 
. Capacities built and integrated and participatory approaches for improving food and nutrition 
security in confined spaces (and among Syrian refugees) institutionalized by stakeholders, such as 
Directorates for Food, Agriculture and Livestock, AFAD and local NGOs. 


Key activities: 

. Provide technical assistance and specialized agricultural inputs for the design, establishment and 
operation of seasonal gardens in selected refugee camps. 
. Conduct rapid needs assessments and identify beneficiaries (with focus on women and youth) in 
partnership with AFAD and local NGOs. 





. Undertake simple garden design and planting regimes (of appropriate, nutritious and saleable fruit, 
vegetables and herbs) for project beneficiaries. 
. Provide the necessary and appropriate tools and planting materials to beneficiary households 
(e.g. seeds, cuttings and seedlings, organic and chemical fertilizers, pesticides, hand tools, watering 
cans, containers and protective shade and netting). 
. Train project beneficiaries in new and improved horticultural technologies and practices (especially 
for confined spaces), integrated pest management, food handling and safety, and produce grading 
and packaging through group-based participatory extension approaches. 
. Identify and support women and youth willing and ready to engage in setting up hygienic food-
based retail shops in the Syrian refugee camps. 
. Train project implementing partners/service providers in participatory extension approaches, „urban 
farming/micro-gardening. production technologies and practices, good agricultural practices, and 
new and improved post-harvest management technologies and principles of food nutrition and 
health. 
. Develop urban farming/micro-gardening and food nutrition and health education strategies for 
Syrian refugees, for replication in other refugee camps and any future protracted disaster.

Agricultural Livelihoods and Food Security Impact Assessment and 

Response Plan for the Syria Crisis in the Neighbouring Countries 

Region/Country 

Turkey 

Project Name 

T2. Recovery and rehabilitation of smallholder agricultural production and 
marketing in the impoverished Syria border areas of Turkey 

Objective 

To restore income-generating capacities of poor and vulnerable Turkish farming 
families from communities hosting refugees in the border areas with Syria 
through the recovery of their agricultural livelihoods 

Beneficiaries 

Some 2 000 poor and vulnerable smallholder farming households living in rural 
communities that are hosting Syrian refugees and have lost at least half of their 
annual farm income as a result of the Syria crisis 

Implementing 
partners 

Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock, and local NGOs and CBOs 

Duration 

Two years 

Starting date 

April 2013 (subject to the availability of funds) 

Funds requested 

USD 12 000 000 

Rationale and justification: 

Smallholder families farming within 5 km of the Syria border in Gaziantep, Hatay, Kilis and Saniurfa 
Provinces have lost more than half of their annual household income as a result of the Syria crisis 
through, viz: (i) more than 40 percent falls in farm-gate prices for grapes, olives and pistachio nuts 
because Syrian refugees are returning to their farms, harvesting their crops and returning to Turkey to 
sell their produce to processors/wholesalers at much reduced prices; (ii) shortages of animal fodder and 
high animal feed prices and vaccination costs; (iii) insecurity close to the border and looting/damage to 
irrigation equipment/structures and loss of fruit trees (through a lack of irrigation); (iv) loss of local 
cross-border trading opportunities with neighbouring communities; and (v) high agricultural input and 
fuel prices, limited access to agricultural credit and poor dairy animal hygiene (the latter, is not as a 
consequence of the Syria crisis but a compounding issue). 

 

The Government of Turkey.s Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock has subsequently requested 
FAO to mobilize resources and provide technical and financial assistance to support a project to 
provide 50 percent grant assistance for key agricultural inputs and capacity building to smallholder 
farming families affected by the Syria crisis. It is proposed that the project be funded or co-funded by 
the ongoing FAO-Turkey Partnership Programme (implemented by FAO), following the modalities of 
the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock-supported “Rural Development Support Programme” 
and “South-Eastern Anatolia Project Action Plan”. 

Expected outcome: 

Restoration of the agricultural livelihoods of rural communities hosting Syrian refugees through the 
provision of short-term subsidies for key agricultural inputs and capacity development in good agricultural 
practices. 

Expected results: 

. Improved farm incomes through reduced agricultural input costs and increases in crop and livestock 
production. 
. Enhanced household income generation for affected farming families through increased 
opportunities in food processing, packaging, storage and marketing. 
. Capacities of stakeholders built to financially and environmentally sustain the project.s interventions 
(i.e. 120 staff of public and private service providers, and male and female beneficiary farmers). 


Key activities: 

. Conduct rapid needs assessments and identify beneficiaries in partnership with local NGOs and CBOs. 





. Provide technical assistance and supervise the provision of 50 percent grants to affected 
smallholder farming families – through vouchers for the procurement of livelihood recovery 
packages, such as animal fodder and vaccines, wheat and lentil seeds, fertilizers, irrigation 
equipment, organic farming equipment and materials, tractor spare parts and fuel, and household 
agroprocessing and storage. 
. Provide technical assistance and appropriate equipment and materials and supervise the provision 
of appropriate equipment and materials in support of household-based food processing, packaging 
and marketing interventions for high-value dairy and meat products, fruit, vegetables, etc. 
. Improve the quality and hygiene of food handling and processing (in particular milk production, 
packaging, transportation and marketing) through the provision of mini-sanitary and grading kits to 
household-based processing units. 
. Provide training to public and private service providers in group-based participatory extension 
approaches (e.g. farmer field schools), group dynamics and administration, value chain 
development, food safety control, etc. 
. Transfer good agricultural practices, new improved crop and livestock production and post-harvest 
technologies and practices, improved water management, good hygiene and food safety practices 
to male and female beneficiary farmers through the implementation of farmer field schools.
