ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 

 

This report is the product of a meeting between The Ministry of Planning and International 
Cooperation (MOPIC) and the United Nations team regarding displaced Syrians in Jordan. In light of the 
discussions, UN Agencies proposed that an assessment be carried out to assess the overall situation, along 
with the humanitarian needs and coping mechanisms of Syrians in Jordan, and to provide a framework for 
relief interventions. MOPIC and the UN are thankful to the Syrians in Jordan for the time they devoted to 
the mission team to explain the situation and constraints they face in their daily life. The field mission 
members had the opportunity to have extensive discussions with Syrian representatives and would like to 
express their gratitude for the frank and productive exchange of views. 

 

Our appreciation also goes to the Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for its support of 
the mission. Special thanks are extended to the staff in MOPIC and Department of Statistics (DOS), who 
provided the team with the opportunity to better understand the situation, as well as the staff of many 
NGOs who openly shared with us their experiences, achievements and operational issues of concern. The 
members of the mission highly appreciated the hard work of the Jordan Hashemite Charity Organization 
(JHCO), who made arrangements for the mission members to make extensive visits and mobilized its 
staff to facilitate interviews and to allow mission members to have rich exchanges with persons of 
concern (POCs). 

 

Last but not least, many thanks go to our colleagues in UNHCR, WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, 
UNESCO, and WFP offices in Jordan, as without their support, preparation of the visits, sharing of 
background documents and providing technical advice, this mission wouldn’t be carried out.

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 

From March 2011 till June 2012, according to Government estimates, more than 120,000 Syrians 
moved and stayed in Jordan as a result of the unrest. The fact that Jordan has left its borders open to 
Syrians and is known for its favourable protection climate has further augmented the number of arrivals. 
Many Syrians arrived already destitute, having had to deplete their resources while still in Syria. Unlike 
Iraqis who are concentrated in the capital Amman, Syrians have scattered throughout Jordan, with the 
largest concentrations in the border districts (Irbid and Mafraq) as well as Amman, Zarqa, Karak and 
Ma’an. 

 

Following consultations between the Government of Jordan (GOJ- represented by the Ministry of 
Planning and International Cooperation- MOPIC, and the Department of Statistics- DOS), the Jordan 
Hashemite Charity Organization (JHCO), and UN agencies, it was agreed to carry out a needs assessment 
of the Syrian population in Jordan (those that arrived as a result of the unrest) with the following goals: 

 

1) To obtain a holistic overview of the situation of Syrians in Jordan. 
2) To identify the humanitarian needs of Syrians and prioritize them. 
3) To understand the coping mechanisms of Syrians in Jordan. 
4) To provide a framework for immediate relief interventions. 


 

For this purpose, a Task Force was established consisting of MOPIC, Ministry of Health (MOH), 
Ministry of Education (MOE), DOS, JHCO, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP and WHO. 
The Task Force agreed on methodology (Participatory Assessment), sectors (coping strategies, income 
and expenditure, food security, health and reproductive health, education and protection) and 
geographical coverage (Amman, Mafraq, Ramtha, Irbid and Zarqa) of the needs assessment. 

 

The participatory assessment methodology consisted of focus group interviews, which were 
conducted with over 300 persons of concern (POCs) grouped by age (youth, adult and elderly) and 
gender, as well as interviews with key informants, i.e. individuals close to the community such as 
government officials. 

 

Results can be summarized as follows: 

 

. Coping mechanisms/ income/ expenditures/ food 


 

A large proportion of Syrians (over 55% of adult males interviewed) are skilled labourers. Among 
the unskilled labourers many worked in agriculture (e.g. seasonal workers who stayed in Jordan because 
of the unrest in Syria); others were employees in private and public sectors in Syria. 

 

In Jordan employment opportunities are limited, for non-Jordanians as well as Jordanians, in 
particular in poorer governorates, indicating the need for support to host communities. In the agricultural 
sector, because of the much larger numbers of Syrians as compared to previous years, as a result of the 
fact that many seasonal workers have decided to stay in Jordan instead of returning to Syria, supply of 
labour outstrips demand. One (negative) coping mechanism is to engage minors in labour, as it seems 
easier for minors to find work due to the fact that they typically work in the informal sector where a 
work-permit is not required. Main expenditures are on rent, food and health; and milk and diapers for 
families with children under 3 years old. Most of the Syrians are in debt and dependent on food parcels 
and financial assistance provided to them by different non-governmental organizations or individuals. 
Some Syrians sell the food parcels as its content does not match their diet, to secure some cash. 

 


. Health 


 

The main health problems among Syrians in Jordan are acute respiratory conditions followed by 
chronic diseases (such as hypertension and diabetes). Children in particular suffer depression and 
emotional distress. Syrians can access public health facilities that are highly subsidised but not all the 
needed services are available. Furthermore, not all Syrians are aware that they can access these services. 
As a result some turn to the private health sector. Syrians also reported a lack of awareness of the fact that 
vaccines are free to all children under five years old. Health services are heavily subsidized by the 
Government, and more than 9% of the public budget is allocated for the health sector. Hosting Syrians 
and allowing them to have access to public health services free of charge will increase the burden on the 
budget. 

 

. Education 


 

In spite of the high number of school-age Syrians who fled to Jordan, and also despite the fact that 
the Government of Jordan has allowed the Syrians to register free of charge in public schools, the focus 
group discussions revealed a worrying number of children who were not attending schools. Syrians seem 
to lack awareness of available public education services. Enrolment in secondary education seemed to be 
lower than in primary level since a proportion of adolescents (12-18) seem to work to meet the basic 
needs of their families. The number of Syrian students enrolled at public schools for the current academic 
year reached 7,376. The increasing number of students requires additional funding to enable the 
Government to absorb them and maintain a good quality of education. 

 

. Protection 


 

Majority of Syrians feel safe in Jordan but there is an overall lack of information about UNHCR and 
its mandate, which provides fertile soil for rumours. E.g. Syrians think that UNHCR will share their 
profiles with the Syrian government and that if they register with the organization, they cannot exercise 
their right of voluntary repatriation. In addition, the majority of Syrians believe that the services provided 
by the UNHCR are inadequate and do not encourage registration. Moreover, since the government of 
Jordan is hosting them with generosity they do not consider protection against non-refoulement a reason 
to register. The location of UNHCR registration premises in Amman is another obstacle to registration 
even for Syrians who are residing in Amman. This perception may have now changed with record 
numbers of Syrians approaching the Agency to register during May and June. 

 

In general, children reported feeling safe and protected in Jordan however a few child protection risks 
were identified including child labour. As far as women are concerned, there is a general sense of feeling 
safe and protected in Jordan. Cases of sexual violence and rape while in Syria were reported. The victims 
suffer trauma and are in need of health care and psychosocial support along with further follow up. Of 
concern is the phenomenon that Syrian women justify being victims of domestic violence perpetrated by 
male relatives given the pressures they are facing in Jordan. Single young females appear to be under 
additional pressure from the family, and at times under pressure to enter into early marriage with 
Jordanians, as a way to support and protect the whole family. 

 

. Gaps and needs/ support and assistance 


 

Syrians in Jordan benefit from a number of items and commodities that are subsidized by the 
Government in order to ease the burden on citizens in the country. Among the subsidized items are bread, 
cooking gas cylinder, electricity, and water. Receiving 120 thousand Syrians requires an increase in the 
allocations to subsidize the commodities and items which are considered as basic needs for the 
population. The main priorities in all age groups regardless of gender were the related needs of rent and 
income. Short of unhindered access to the labour market, there emerged a clear preference for cash 
assistance over food and in-kind distribution, the latter often being seen as low quality, not corresponding 
to dietary habits and humiliating, especially when distribution takes place in public. In general, the 
Government of Jordan needs support in dealing with a predominantly urban caseload, with concomitant 


pressure on public services such as water, electricity, health and education, and subsidised commodities.

2. INTRODUCTION 

 

Since March 2011, violence in Syria, notably in the cities of Homs, Dara’a, Douma and Hama has 
been on-going. The violence has caused a deterioration of humanitarian conditions in parts of the country. 
On the Syrian side of the border with Jordan, citizens of Dara’a have been living in extremely precarious 
conditions with little water, electricity, fuel and scarce food items. Large numbers of rural people in the 
central, coastal, eastern and southern governorates have reported that they have lost their businesses, 
farms and/or livestock due to the on-going crisis as they have not been able to engage in commercial or 
farming activity. High transportation costs, movement restrictions, and increasing commodity prices have 
all adversely affected the farming industry as well. Agriculture in these areas was also reliant on seasonal 
migrant farm labourers from eastern and north-eastern Syria who have been forced back home to drought-
affected areas. Lacking income-earning opportunities, the affected population depleted their assets and 
savings. In addition, hundreds of women-headed households have lost their only available source of 
family income. 

 

Jordan has maintained an open borders policy with Syrians crossing into Jordan and seeking asylum 
and as a result, more than 120,000 Syrians crossed the borders since March 2011. At the time of writing 
this report, UNHCR registered over 20,000 Syrians and this number is increasing rapidly, UNHCR 
estimates that it will continue to register some 5,000 to 7,000 Syrians in Jordan per month for the 
foreseeable future. This could even be increased further subject to Government approval of off-site 
registration. 

 

Based on a proposal by the UN Agencies, to the Government of Jordan (GoJ) represented by the 
Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation, and the Department of Statistics, along with the 
Jordanian Hashemite Charity Organization, agreed for an assessment with the following goals: 

 

1) To obtain a holistic overview on the Syrians’ situation in Jordan. 
2) To identify the humanitarian needs of Syrians and prioritize them. 
3) To understand the coping mechanisms of Syrians in Jordan. 
4) To provide a framework for immediate relief interventions. 


 

For this purpose, an assessment Task Force was established, consisting of MOPIC, DOS, MOH, 
MOE, JHCO, UNHCR, WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, UNESCO and WFP. During a number of meetings the 
Task Force agreed on methodology (Participatory Assessment- see below) sectors (coping strategies, 
income and expenditure, food security, health and reproductive health, education and protection) and 
geographical coverage (Amman, Mafraq, Ramtha, Irbid and Zarqa). 

 

Followed by a brief explanation of the methodology and modalities applied, this report summarizes 
the outcome of the rapid needs assessment for the various sectors. The reporting is exclusively based on 
comprehensive information received from POCs in confidential settings, in their own words. As such, the 
report does not intend to publish the information received, although it does include recommendations. 

 

 


3. METHODOLOGY 

 

The Participatory Assessment is an active “research” involving participation of all concerned 
stakeholders through structured dialogue, in order to gather accurate information on the specific 
protection risks Syrians face and the underlying causes, to understand their coping capacities, and to hear 
their proposed solutions. This tool has been found to be extremely beneficial in ensuring that men, 
women and children regardless of their backgrounds are given the opportunity to identify their priorities, 
opinions and solutions while enhancing both the knowledge base and partnerships with persons of 
concern. 

 

The main tool of the Participatory Assessment is the Semi-Structured Interviews; applied in focus 
group discussions on a few key topics with groups separated by age and gender, and more in depth key 
informant interviews with persons directly engaged in the situation and possessing valuable first-hand 
knowledge, including community leaders and Government officials. 

 

This process results in detailed, qualitative information in relation to specific topics and allows for an 
initial analysis of the challenges faced by women, girls, men and boys in the community. It is also an 
opportunity to gather insights into cultural practices, traditional protection mechanisms, and other issues 
which maybe affecting community members. 

 

The Task Force developed two check lists to structure focus group discussions and key informants 
interviews around key questions regarding protection, access to health and education, child labor, 
economic conditions and livelihoods, dynamics of co-existence, sense of community and future plans. 

 

UNHCR and WFP conducted a two day training workshop for the joint UN and DOS teams who 
carried out the participatory assessments in the field. The workshop was conducted in Arabic to facilitate 
the 27 partricipants, 14 of whom represented DOS and 13 represented the participating UN Agencies. The 
workshop was organized at the DOS offices on the 27th and 28th of March. It covered the concept of 
participation, levels of participation, semi-structured interviews, with special emphasis on the focus 
groups discussion and the key informant interviews. This training was followed by five days of field work 
in Amman, Mafraq, Ramtha, Irbid and Zarqa, respectively. The sampling process and the areas were 
identified according to the data on the distribution of Syrian families provided by the JHCO.

The focus group discussions were conducted separately with women and men, grouped into three 
age/sex groups: youth females, youth males, adult females, adult males, elderly females, and elderly 
males (see Table 1). 

 

A total of 24 focus group discussions were conducted, along with seven key informant interviews 
with Governors, heads of community based organizations and the heads of health and education 
Departments at the governorate level.

3.1. Limitations 

 

A relatively small sample was surveyed. The problem of willingness to answer certain questions was 
partially addressed by using experienced and trained staff. This was a qualitative assessment and 
empirical data was not collected. Based on the results of this assessment, a household assessment could 
be designed and implemented to generate statistics on demography, coping strategies, incomes and 
expenditures, and food. 

 

4. COPING STRATEGIES, INCOME AND EXPENDITURES 

 

Syrians who have recently arrived in Jordan stay in 
low cost rental apartments or live with host families 
under difficult circumstances. They take up whatever 
employment is available, which is often unskilled and on 
a day by day basis but the majority remain without a 
source of income. Due to the fact that unemployment rate 
is high in Jordan (12.9% in 2011), it is difficult for men 
who are most in need of employment to have job 
opportunities and are unable to afford the cost of work 
permits for jobs that are open to non-Jordanians. One 
coping strategy adopted by families is to engage children 
in income generation by working as painters, in garments 
shops, agriculture and even the steel industry. Women 
work as/for tailors and in beauty salons. If all else fails, a 
final coping strategy would be to return to Syria. For 
many Syrians however, in particular those who crossed 
the border illegally, returning home is not an option. Lack 
of income sources for these families is a serious concern for families and the local administrators.

Charities have been the mainstay providers of the support received by the Syrians. In addition, a large 
percentage of aid is provided by Jordanian individuals and committees that complement what the charity 
organizations are providing. Currently, the reasons of the charity organizations are running out and 
therefore require external support and funding. Most families interviewed were in debt and only have 
access to small loans as they lack collateral. Most families have changed their diets to less expensive 
foods, reducing the intake of meat, fish, chicken and dairy products, including milk for children. Some 
rural families brought preserved food (from their farms) with them from Syria. However, these are 
exceptions and in general, the Syrians rely on local markets for their food needs. 

 

The Government of Jordan has provided access for Syrians to public health services free of charge, 
which is causing extra burden on the budget and the quality of services. Women who are not aware of the 
fact that reproductive and child health services are for free in public health centers have reported avoiding 
visits to doctors in order to limit expenses, which is having a negative effect on health, particularly 
children. Some families have chosen not to send children to school while others have pulled children out 
of school because they could not meet the expenses despite the fact that the Government exempts them 
from school fees and text books. These children often end up working to add to the meager family 
incomes. 

 

Rents in Jordan are high and JHCO through its local partner Al-KitabwalSunnah (KAS) pays about 
US$141 to US$170 for simple housing that could accommodate a small family. 

 

Utilities costs vary and are averaged as being around US$70 per month. As low rent accommodations 
are sought, Syrians have to pay for all utilities, such as electricity, water and cooking gas. These items, 
although subsidized by the government, are expensive in Jordan. It must be noted that the current 
arrangements are unsustainable and there must be a more coherent approach to meet the accommodation 
needs. The situation regarding food is similar, while there are currently several channels providing food 
parcels or cash for food, these are ad hoc arrangements totally dependent on availability.

Jordan 


 

Syrians have expressed a sense of ambiguity 
in terms of aid from humanitarian agencies. 
They are not aware of their entitlements and the 
procedures through which aid could be received. 
Moreover they are not informed about the 
continuity of such assistance. A coherent 
approach to humanitarian aid delivery is 
required to avoid cases being excluded from 
assistance provided by NGOs and UN agencies. 
Families were under financial stress for at least a 
whole year prior to their crossing the border. 
Therefore, their capacity to liquidate assets and 
bring money to Jordan was very limited. Some 
had to pay their way out of Syria. As a result 
most arrived with little assets and cash. The cost 
of living in Jordan is almost twice of that in Syria. Consequently, most families depleted their reserves in 
the first three months of their arrival.

Tanked water is expensive with about a monthly expense of US$42 for drinking andUS$21 for 
washing. Water shortage has become of permanent nature in Jordan and meeting water demands is a 
critical challenge. Jordan has reached a water crisis juncture that is expected to deepen; as present water 
use already exceeds the renewable freshwater resources by more than 20%. Jordanian's share of fresh 
water per year at less than 145 cubic meters, compared to global poverty line of water of 500 cubic meters 
while the world average is 4,000 cubic meters, which places serious constraints on the country’s overall 
development process. The Government of Jordan maintains high levels of subsidies in water sector and 
the public water services that are provided by the Water Authority of Jordan. 

 


Apart from rent, the most important recurring cost is food, estimated to be around US$352 for a 
small family (two adults, two children). Many families have arrived with family members injured in the 
conflict, these injuries are of serious nature and require high quality medical treatment and care. 

 

Most Syrians have come with children. The GoJ estimates, that as of end of May, 7376 Syrian 
children are enrolled in local schools. The GoJ’s school feeding program is already constrained due to 
budgetary constraints. Budget reduction has resulted in a decrease of school meals for 700,000 to only 
150,000 students. Consequently, several schools have withdrawn their meal program. There is a need to 
provide urgent budget support to the Government to be able to re-instate meal programs at schools for 
students. 

4.1. Skills Set 

A large group of Syrians consists of skilled laborers. These include machine operators, computer and 
mobile phone technicians, tile workers, steel workers, carpenters, painters, masons, electricians, etc. 
Amongst the unskilled laborers, most worked in the construction industry, in grocery shops, as farm 
laborers, office messengers, drivers, etc. Some owned private businesses (restaurant, stores) while others 
worked for the government. Syrian skilled laborers are more likely to find work in the urban sector. 
Syrians with a background in tiling have settled in Zarqa and seem to have found income sources due to 
their skills background. 

 

Casual laborers- in construction- have also settled in urban areas. Seasonal male laborers from Syria 
traditionally come to Jordan to work in agriculture, e.g. as olive pickers. This group of men would 
normally return to their villages across the border after the harvest season. However, due to the conflict, 
many have stayed and some have moved their families to Jordan. 

 

With the huge number of arrivals, the seasonal employment opportunities have become limited, and 
many seek employment beyond the harvest season. 

 

Many Syrians live in rural areas in the poorer governorates of Jordan. These governorates include the 
“poverty pockets” as defined by the GoJ, with some governorates recording over 20% unemployment 
rate. Programming for the POCs must consider inclusion of the host communities as, failing to do so 
could result in animosity from the local community and loss of local support. 

4.2. Current Income Sources 

Labor opportunities are very limited. A casual labor could earn US$21 per day, with many earning 
far less. However, only 12% of those registered with KAS indicated having stable incomes. Jordanian 
employment laws are strictly enforced. A work permit, mandatory for Syrian workers, costs US$388. 
This fee is beyond the capacity of the Syrians and seldom paid by the employer. Consequently, finding 
legal employment is a challenge. As time passes, local donations dwindle, savings are exhausted and 
negative coping strategies may set in. These could vary from working without a permit to more serious 
offenses such as theft, prostitution, etc. Hence, for Syrians who may obtain work permits in areas open 
for non-Jordanian, noting that due to high levels of unemployment (12.9%) the Government has narrow 
areas of work for non-Jordanian labor. 

 

Based on their skill sets and experience, Syrians have sought work in Jordan in their respective fields. 

 

In general, education and skill levels of Syrians in Jordan are lower than Iraqis. This distinction 
should have a bearing on the response for these Syrians and must be considered carefully while adapting 
response programs. 

4.3. Expenditures 

The main expenditures are on house rent, food, medical expenses, milk, diapers for babies and 
sanitation. Utilities costs vary and averaged around US$70 per month. Aid parcels from charity 


organizations do not contain baby diapers and powdered milk. Consequently, Syrians incur debt to meet 
their needs which results in an additional burden on the families with children. 

 

According to the Government officials, the main needs are house rent and food. According to the 
focus group participants, Syrians have reduced their food quantities and qualities in order to cope with 
their restricted incomes. Markets have the food commodities but the Syrians lack the purchasing power. 

 

Subsidized items such as Gas and kerosene are available for cooking and heating, but Syrians are not 
used to kerosene and its improper use is causing health problems for children. 

 

The majority of Syrians interviewed are staying in rented houses, and pay monthly between US$100-
380, for furnished houses between - US$282-495.Part of the rent in some cases is covered by local NGOs, 
provided that a copy of the rental contract is handed to the organization which is problematic for families 
staying with other families since they do not have a contract. Some are staying with Jordanian families 
and Syrian families permanently residing in Jordan. 

 

Electricity and water services are available and heavily subsidized by the Government but present an 
additional cost to the rental fees and are not covered by charity organizations. 

 

Some Syrians are staying in houses for free, but the conditions are poor. In many cases more than 
one family lives in the same house under difficult conditions. Sometimes it is hard to find houses for 
rent, especially for single young men with no source of income. 

 

Furthermore, to alleviate their psychosocial stress, Syrians communicate with their families by phone 
in Syria which increases the burden on their expenses. 

4.4. Conclusions 

1) Hosting thousands of Syrians in Jordan causes more pressure on the Kingdom’s already scarce 
resources, particularly in the sectors of water, energy, health, and education, which requires 
additional public spending to maintain the current quality of services in these key sectors. It also 
requires an increase in the allocations to subsidize the commodities and items which are considered 
as basic needs for the population. 
2) Moreover, hosting a large number of displaced people in the country has indirect costs as well, 
including: depletion of resources, competition with Jordanian youth on limited job opportunities, 
and expansion of the informal sector in addition to other social effects. Jordan today provides free 
public education, health services, subsidized water, electricity and household gas, in addition to 
subsidized bread, as well as basic commodities to all the Syrians on its territory helping the most 
vulnerable make ends meet. 
3) In poorer governorates, employment for locals is also limited and competition from unskilled 
Syrians creates social problems (host communities also need support). 
4) Rent, food and health are vital needs, which require a coherent mechanism of targeting and 
delivery. 
5) Employment opportunities are limited and work permits unaffordable. 
6) Children are engaged in income generation instead of schooling. 
7) The primary sources of income for most Syrian families prior to fleeing to Jordan were: manual 
daily work, farming or employment in private and public sectors. This was also confirmed by 
different key informants during interviews conducted in Amman, Ramtha, Irbid, Zarqa and Mafraq. 
For instance, the Governors in Ramtha and Mafraq confirmed that some Syrians used to work in 
Jordan in some professions prior to the crisis in Syria such as farming. 
8) Most of the Syrians are dependent on food parcels and financial assistance provided to them by 
different non-governmental organizations or individuals. 



9) Local charity and support is being exhausted by the large number of Syrians. 
10) Some Syrians sell the food parcels as its content does not match their diet, to secure some 
cash. 
11) A big portion of Syrians mentioned that bottled water and tanks are unaffordable. The 
medical needs are a concern for most Syrians in the different age groups. 
12) Syrians of all different age groups do not have savings. Most Syrians are in debt, with only 
one group, females over 60 years old, confirming that they are not. This information was also 
confirmed by the Governor of Ramtha and the key informant in Amman. 


4.5. Recommendations 

13) The international community should provide support to the government of Jordan to be able 
to continue subsidizing the basic needs and commodities and providing the services needed for all 
i.e. education, health, energy, and others. This will help the Government to give Syrians access to 
the Jordanian medical services and continue providing access to Syrian children to its public 
schools. 
14) To consider the possibility of providing monthly cash assistance to vulnerable Syrians in 
Jordan according to criteria agreed upon with the Government. Financial assistance is considered a 
main protection tool which avoids opting for illegal work, exposure to exploitation and other 
negative coping mechanisms. The financial assistance seeks to protect Syrians’ dignity since the 
assistance can be based on their needs which they themselves prioritize and it can be brought to 
them- through ATM cards- in a more dignified manner than in-kind assistance. 
15) Were cash assistance is not appropriate, a voucher system could be considered. 
16) Programmes that engage affected local populations should be introduced to provide incomes 
and to create assets in rural areas of Jordan. 
17) Implement information sharing and coordination of programs among UN agencies. 
18) Training and awareness raising of local NGOs and governorates’ staff. 
19) Provide assistance directly to the Government to continue with and expand the school feeding 
program in public schools. 


 


5. FOOD SECURITY 

5.1. Availability 

Food is readily and abundantly available in the Jordanian markets. Areas near the Syrian border also 
stock food produced from Syrian farms. The Syrian population, in comparison to the local population, is 
relatively small but if the increased demand is not met with sufficient supply on a timely basis, this would 
have an inflationary impact on food prices. It is estimated that less than 5% of the Syrians stay in rural 
areas, and the majority live in close proximately to urban markets with a full variety of food items on 
sale. 

5.2. Utilization 

Most Syrians have taken shelter in low cost urban dwellings or live with host families under difficult 
circumstances. Facilities for storing, cooking and preserving food are often absent or of low quality. This 
impacts the utilization aspect of food security. Most families have reported a drastic change in their food 
consumption behavior. Meat, chicken and fish have been omitted for most families. Fruits and milk for 
children is limited due to the high cost. These modified diets may provide the caloric requirements but 
would have long term impacts unless supplemented with adequate micro-nutrients. 

5.3. Conclusions 

As earlier mentioned food is one of a number of vital needs, which requires a coherent mechanism of 
targeting and delivery, and support to the Government is important to continue subsidizing bread and 
indirectly local meat products. 

5.4. Recommendations 

1) Donors should support the budget to enable the Government continue subsidizing basic 
commodities and items. 
2) Food assistance for vulnerable Syrians, in coordination with cash distribution should be provided. 
3) Implement a robust monitoring system for food needs and food utilization. 
4) Explore possibilities of CFW/Voucher schemes, bearing in mind the cash assistance provided 
through ATM card to be rolled out for Syrians upon approval of the Government on the criteria and 
distribution mechanism. 
5) Advocacy of special distribution during Ramadan. 


 

 


 

6. HEALTH AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH 

6.1. Main Health Problems 

Nearly all Focus Groups reported that they suffer from acute respiratory infections / cough and cold 
and allergies (also of the respiratory tract), which is expected due to the winter season, over-crowding and 
to indoor pollution resulting from gasoline heaters. Diarrheal diseases were reported by one group only. 
Many explained their complaints by the damp premises and inadequate water quality. 

 

Other conditions reported were chronic diseases, mainly hypertension and diabetes mellitus, but also 
cardiac, renal, joint / bone problems and problems of the gastro-intestinal tract (colonic complaints). 
Cases in need of long-term care find it difficult to access adequate health care in Jordan and some cases 
develop complications as a result (e.g. chronic renal failure). Gynecologic complaints were also reported, 
in addition to pediatric illnesses, dental and ophthalmic complaints 

 

Key informants have indicated that diabetes and hypertension are among the problems faced by 
Syrians in addition to cardiac conditions and renal failure. Injuries and exhaustion during their movement 
from Syria to Jordan were also mentioned. 

6.2. Mental Health and Psychological Well-being 

Mental illnesses and complaints were reported by nearly all focus groups. Children in particular were 
reported to be experiencing symptoms of depression and emotional distress. Things that would make 
other children happy such as fireworks were triggering their fears because they reminded them of 
explosions back home. Children are showing isolation, are using escape mechanisms, and are 
experiencing enuresis (bedwetting) and crying attacks. 

 

Young men indicated that they suffer mental problems and disturbances resulting from the events in 
Syria. Some have become aggressive and behave erratically. Adults are also suffering depression and 
fear, especially women. One female victim of torture was raped in Syria, and currently suffers the mental, 
physical (enuresis) and social (divorced) consequences of the event. There are reports of panic attacks, 
increased tension, emotional distress and fear of the future. 

 

Key informants have referred to mental problems as present among Syrians. However, they had no 
accurate information on their prevalence, types or severity. 

6.3. Reproductive Health (RH) 

In general, responses from FGD participants (all males, and women over 60 years) were not 
informative as they considered this as a matter for young females that they were not aware of. All other 
women groups indicated that they seek RH services mainly for oral contraceptive pills, condoms and for 
antenatal care. There was no mention of the need for gynecologic services or treatment for genital tract 
infections in spite of this being identified as one of the main health problems. However, appointing a 
female gynecologist was identified as an urgent need since husbands refuse that their wives be checked 
by a male doctor. 

6.4. Access to Health Services in Jordan 

Responses to this question varied markedly between the various focus groups, and were very much 
related to awareness of the existence of the services, their geographical locations, the cost and the users’ 
eligibility to access these services. Those Syrians who are not aware that services provided by Ministry of 
Health (MoH) hospitals and primary health care centres (PHCCs) are free-of-charge, resort to private 
providers. Most Syrians in Amman reported that they seek services from the private sector, and due to the 
high cost of the doctors’ consultation, many were purchasing medications directly from private 
pharmacies. High transport cost to the health facilities has also hindered access. Some reported that 
Syrian doctors practicing in Jordan were providing health care free-of-charge. 


 

Some services are not available to the Syrians such as dental and ophthalmic. Some have reported 
that they do not prefer to access services provided by the PHCCs because they cannot get what they need 
(medications, X-Rays and investigations), especially for chronic conditions such as diabetes. Radiological 
services are available from public hospitals but with long waiting lists. Older participants reported that 
health services are available either free-of-charge or at subsidized cost from MoH facilities. Emergency 
health services were provided by public hospitals and are free-of-charge even for those un-registered with 
UNHCR. 

 


In the north (Irbid, Mafraq and Ramtha) young females reported that UNHCR registered Syrians seek 
health services from Jordan Health Aid Society (JHAS) clinics since they are provided free-of-charge. 
Syrians have reported that there is competition for these services with Iraqis. One participant indicated 
that she sought care from (Abu Huraira) clinic and was provided with medications for once only, which 
were not enough. 

 

There was a lack of awareness among most participants on RH services provided by the government 
and about their cost. Accordingly, women seek these services from the private clinics (for maternity 
services) and from pharmacies (for contraceptives). Few participants knew about RH services provided 
free of charge by JHAS. One woman mentioned that a JHAS female gynecologist conducts home visits 
once a week for pregnant women. 

 

Key informants indicated that Syrians can access health and RH services from PHCCs and public 
hospitals free-of–charge or against nominal fees for the UNHCR registered, Community-Based 
Organizations (CBOs) registered or those with an entry stamp on their passports. Those who have crossed 
illegally can get the stamp at the CBOs to access the services. Some are referred to the private sector for 
higher level care. Syrians fear going to PHCCs and being stamped as “refugees”. Deliveries are all free-
of-charge. Some Syrian private doctors practicing in Jordan provide services free-of-charge, as well as 
some Jordanian private doctors. 

 

In Ramtha, Syrians reported that they can seek services from the public sector, private sector and 
NGOs clinics. In Irbid, they reported that they buy drugs over-the-counter to avoid paying the 
consultation cost. They complained about being mistreated by one doctor in the NGO clinic. Some have 
reported that an NGO lady doctor pays home visits to pregnant women. Respondents from Zarqa used the 
private sector and have just found out about JHAS. 

 

Key informants indicated that Syrians access public services, private services and NGO services. The 
NGOs mentioned in particular were JHAS, Médecins Sans Frontières(MSF) (for surgical cases) and Noor 
Al Hussein Foundation (NHF),the Al-Ata’a Medical Center andAL-KitabwalSunnah Society. 

6.5. Cost of Health Services 

Health services are heavily subsidized by the Government, and more than 9 percent of the public 
budget is allocated for the health sector. Therefore, the Government estimated additional allocations to be 
budgeted annually to provide health services needed to meet the increasing demand of the additional 
number of beneficiaries. 

 

Across the Focus groups there was a consensus that the cost of health services was high including the 
cost of consultations, medications and transportation. Surgical procedures were reported to be 
unaffordable. 

 

Some Syrians have mentioned that medications are provided by a certain pharmacy for half the price, 
and sometimes free. Some indicated that they cannot buy drugs due to their high cost, and many reported 
that they had discontinued treatment for chronic illnesses because they cannot afford the cost. 

 

Syrians residing in different governorates have pointed out specific issues. Those in Amman 
complained about the high cost of lab investigations, and the unavailability of medications for chronic 


diseases. They reported that those registered with UNHCR should pay 20% of the cost of medicines. Irbid 
residents reported that medications are very expensive and they get them from Syria. Mafraq residents 
said that health services are available, but their cost is unaffordable. There is a lack of clarity among the 
Syrians about which services they can access, and at what cost. 

 

Key informants indicated that UNHCR registered Syrians are treated free-of-charge in PHCCs and 
hospitals and bill sent to the Directorate of Health. This makes them also eligible to receive free health 
services from JHAS clinics. One CBO indicated that they cover the health care bills for its beneficiaries, 
but did not indicate at which level of care. 

 

The cost of treatment of the injured is covered by the Jordanian Syndicate for Engineers, in addition 
to Al-Ata’a Medical Center and Al-KitabwalSunnah Society which cover the cost of treatment of 
emergency cases in hospitals and PHCCs. Deliveries in private hospitals were covered by the society 
(US$350-495 per case). Some informants indicated that Syrians face difficulties paying for health care 
and only seek care in hospitals when they get very sick. 

6.6. Access to Childhood Vaccination Services 

Participants indicated that the lack of awareness of the fact that vaccines are free to all under-fives in 
Jordan deterred some parents from utilizing the service. Another problem was that many parents did not 
have their children’s vaccination cards at hand as they left them in Syria. Many parents reported that they 
did not know where to get their children vaccinated. Some health providers refused to vaccinate children 
who did not have vaccination card, while others could not understand the names of the vaccines that were 
listed on the Syrian cards. 

In Mafraq, Maternal and Child Health Centers (MCHCs) were reported to be very cooperative and to 
provide vaccines free of charge and without asking for their cards from Syria. Most respondents from 
Irbid reported that they have completed the immunizations for their children. All respondents from Zarqa 
have indicated that child health services (weight, height and temperature) were not provided. 

 

Key informants have indicated that vaccines are available for under-fives free-of-charge in all 
PHCCs and MCHCs. In addition, most Syrian families have no vaccination cards, with differences 
between the Jordanian and Syrian schedules. If the family has no card, they are asked about the 
vaccination history of the child and missed doses are provided by Jordanian health facilities. 

6.7. Negative Coping Mechanisms Relevant to Health 

One of the coping mechanisms reported by FGD participants was to avoid going to the doctor, in 
spite of the need to do so, due to cost, lack of the cash, or to use the available cash to buy food. 

6.8. Immediate Priorities Relevant to Health 

Many have reported that their rented homes are damp and not well ventilated, with problems of rot. 
This results in various diseases / ailments. Some have reported that sanitation services are very bad. 

 

Health ranked as the second priority only once, by elderly men, ranked as the third priority three 
times and as the fourth priority five times. Health ranked between second and fifth (but mostly third) 
when the key informants were asked to identify the immediate needs of displaced Syrians in Jordan. 


6.9. Conclusions 

1) The main health problems among Syrians in Jordan are acute conditions followed by chronic 
diseases. The need for mental health and reproductive health information and services were also 
pointed out. 
2) Syrians accessed health services free-of-charge or at nominal fees since health is subsidized by the 
Government, as well from NGO clinics. However, not all the needed services are available, and not 
all Syrians were aware of the services available. 
3) Syrians had to access the expensive private services when they needed medications for chronic 
diseases which they found expensive. Tertiary level care appears to be a problem. 
4) The free vaccination services for under-fives helped to increase access to this service. 


6.10. Recommendations 

 

1) Since the crisis is still evolving, and the situation on the ground may be changing very quickly, the 
increase in demand will overwhelm the capacity of the public health services provided by the 
Jordanian Government, its international partners and the local NGO services. Accordingly, the 
international community should step in to provide support to the Government of Jordan and to the 
international and local organizations working on the ground to ensure access of the Syrians in 
Jordan to quality health, including reproductive health care. 
2) Harmonization of the government subsidized services to be granted to the Syrians with that already 
granted to the Iraqis is advised. This step will make it easier for the Jordanian Government to 
calculate the cost of the provided services and will prevent the sensitivities that may arise due to 
differing service packages. 


 


7. EDUCATION 

 

The number of Syrian students enrolled at public schools for the current academic year at the time of 
the assessment was some 5,500 students in public schools. As of May 2012, the number reached 7376. 
The increasing number of students requires additional funding to enable the Government to absorb them 
and maintain a good quality of education. 

 

Responses of the key informants or the Syrians interviewed do not provide consistent basis to 
establish clear estimates of the proportion of school-age Syrians enrolled in Jordan. However, as 
confirmed by some key informants interviewed, the assessment highlighted low registration of school-age 
Syrians in some geographical areas such as Zarqa and Irbid. A small number of Syrians with post-
secondary education level were recorded and in most cases they were not able to register in Jordan due to 
the high cost of education in Jordanian Tertiary Institutions. 

 

In spite of the high number of school-age Syrians who fled to Jordan, and also despite the fact that 
the Government of Jordan has allowed the Syrians to register free of charge in public schools, the focus 
group discussions revealed a worrying number of (especially secondary) school-age children, who were 
not attending schools. Particularly in Zarqa and Irbid many young children are not enrolled in schools. 

 

However, the increasing demand on public schools facilities and the overcrowded school system is 
hampering the ongoing reform program and affecting the quality of education. It is also making it more 
difficult for the Government to continue with its plans to eliminate the double-shift school system and 
stop renting school buildings. 

 

The majority of children that go to schools are attending public schools, a few are attending the 
Islamic Society Centres for free, or go to private schools. A number of generous Jordanians and charitable 
organizations are covering the tuition fees in some cases. Among the reasons for not attending schools are 
the following: 

 

1) Lack of prior-schooling documentation and other relevant IDs or certificates. 
2) Most of the interviewed male adolescent simply do not wish to go to school and prefer to work in 
order to afford daily basic living expenses. 
3) Lack of knowledge among Syrian community about registration in Jordanian public schools free of 
charge. (NB. it has been noted that many of the adult household leaders are relatively illiterate; 
hence their access to relevant information is also limited). 
4) Some of the interviewed families argue that the school year is almost over, and there is no benefit of 
sending children to school at this point in time. Also most families are expecting to return to Syria 
soon. 
5) Many families recently arrived and were more concerned to secure basic needs such as house rent 
and food, and were not aware of the education services accessible to them in Jordan. 
6) Some children are experiencing psychological difficulties and are feeling insecure to go to school. 
7) The Jordanian curriculum is perceived to be more difficult than the Syrian curriculum (particularly 
in subjects like English and Chemistry). 
8) Enrolment in lower grades in Jordan than in Syria after placement tests was discouraging, and most 
children in such cases preferred dropping out instead. 
9) Many families do not have the resources to spend on the school kits (bags, and the uniform or 
proper clothing). 
10) Some school-age children already dropped-out from education in Syria prior to the unrest and 
cannot easily re-enrol in the school system. 



11) Some school-age Syrians have missed either one or two semester(s) as a consequence of the unrest 
and could have re-enrolled in schools if provided with further catch-up/remedial or tutorial classes. 
12) Registration obstacles at the school level (e.g. some schools have exhausted their capacity or were 
not aware of registration). 
13) Family mobility: Some families reported that they had to change their accommodation which 
entailed challenges on school registration or transferring children from one school to another. 


7.1. Key Needs 

1) Improve the awareness amongst parents/guardians, children and relevant stakeholders on the access 
to public schools 
2) Support the public education system to be able to accommodate the growing number of Syrian 
students. 
3) Enlarge the portfolio of educational and vocational education services with a focus on mitigating 
psychosocial distress. 


7.2. Conclusions 

Syrians seem to lack awareness of the available public education services especially in Zarqa and 
Irbid. Enrolment in secondary education seemed to be lower than in primary level. An important 
proportion of adolescents (12-18) seem to work to meet the basic needs of their families. 

 

Syrian children who are not going to schools need to be re-inserted into the education system or 
alternatively most of the adolescents involved in child labour require alternative education opportunities. 
Given the economic status of the interviewed displaced families, their dependence on public schools is 
clear since private schools are not affordable unless subsidised by donors, which raises sustainability 
issues. There is a need to support the public education system to be able to accommodate the growing 
number of Syrian children. Some participants provided the following suggestions to solve the educational 
problems: 

 

1) Facilitate the enrolment procedures for those students who do not have relevant documentation to 
register in schools. 
2) Increase awareness of Syrian families and relevant stakeholders on the significance and availability 
of free access to education in Jordan. 
3) Provide financial support to families to prevent them from the temptation of sending their children 
to work instead of school. 
4) Provide tutoring or remedial classes in subjects where students face difficulties, such as: English 
and Chemistry. 
5) Provide literacy classes for out-of-school children and their parents. 


7.3. Recommendations 

1) Provide support to the Jordanian public education sector to strengthen the capacity in order to 
accommodate a growing influx of Syrian students while sustaining the quality of education. This 
could include direct budget support to the Government to increase the capacity of the education 
system through building new schools, and/or expanding and adding classrooms, doing the necessary 
maintenance works for some schools, as well covering the running cost including the cost of 
recruiting new teachers. 
2) Conduct awareness campaign for families on children’s right to education and on the available 
education services in Jordan. 
3) Tutoring support or remedial classes for children and youth to facilitate their return to and retention 
in schools. 



4) Literacy campaign and awareness-raising programmes for out of school children and their parents/ 
care givers (especially targeting mothers). 
5) Provide psychosocial support to Syrian students at schools and inform the school counsellors of the 
available psychosocial services for further referrals. 
6) Provide school kits, uniform– among others- for Syrian students and needy students in schools. 
7) Provide non formal education or literacy classes for students that can’t be reintegrated at schools 
and are working. 
8) Post-secondary education opportunities for youth at tertiary levels. 
9) Supporting and monitor the access of Syrian students to primary and secondary education. 
10) Consider undertaking further sectoral research on issues like literacy level, learning achievements, 
completion rates, etc. 


 


8. YOUTH 

 

According to a number of Key Informants and interviewees from all five surveyed areas, youth (13-
24 years old) form a big proportion of the Syrian population that fled their country to Jordan since the 
beginning of the crisis in March 2011. They have also identified the youth group as the most vulnerable 
or at risk category among the Syrians. It appeared that for some reasons the single males are not 
integrating well within the host communities. 

 

During the focus group discussions, the youth reported to have been the most exposed directly to 
killings while in Syria during demonstrations or whenever they refuse to join in hostile activities. They 
reported to be the most aggressively screened at checkpoints. They have in many cases witnessed killings, 
and hence are more affected by psychosocial distress. 

 

An important proportion of adolescents and youth at their early ages (12-18) seems to have no other 
alternative than to work for long hours (between 10-12 hours on average a day), to meet their basic needs 
and those of their relatives. They are generally working in grocery shops where they carry boxes of goods 
and organize them on shelves. Some are waiters in cafes, others selling in vegetable stalls in markets. 
They are also working in physically demanding jobs in the construction industry. In Zarqa in particular, 
most of the youth are working with their families in tiling without receiving any remuneration. 

 

Early marriage of Syrian girls is a risk given the widespread acceptance of early marriage (under 
certain conditions) among the Syrian community. While these practices may in fact amount to a coping 
strategy by a number of Syrians households, they are not necessarily well perceived by everyone within 
the host communities including by Syrian males. 

8.1. Key Needs 

1) Helping youth to overcome their psychosocial distress and to access alternative education 
opportunities. 


8.2. Recommendations 

1) Further identification (through participatory assessments) of the specific needs of male and female 
youth/adolescents in order to develop and implement tailor-made interventions including alternative 
education opportunities such as vocational training. 


 


9. PROTECTION 

9.1. General protection 

On the question of whether or not Syrians are registered with UNHCR and what are the obstacles 
seeking UNHCR protection, 20% to 30% of the male participants in the age group 13-24 already 
approached UNHCR for registration. In contrast, the number of the females of the same age group who 
registered with UNHCR was lower, merely 17 out 62. Participants mentioned the following reasons for 
not registering with UNHCR: 

 

1) Fear that the Syrian government will find out their names and will pursue their families in Syria. 
2) Some of the participants do not know about the existence of UNHCR and its mandate. 
3) Possibility of returning to Syria (hence no need to register). 
4) Rumors: persons registered cannot go back to Syria until the crisis is over or those who register 
with the UNHCR will be placed in tents or even, those who register with UNHCR will be resettled 
and they do not want to live in a western country as they are planning to go back to Syria. 
5) High cost of transportation to come to Amman and register especially since the UNHCR requests 
the presence of the whole family for registration purposes; many are not familiar with the UNHCR 
helpdesk offices in some governorates. 


The number of male participants in the age group 25-60 was 20% to 40%. Male and female 
participants in this age group provided the same reasons as the above age group for not registering with 
UNHCR. However, they added the following few reasons: 

 

1) Some fear deportation to another country if they register with UNHCR. 
2) Some do not trust that UNHCR will grant them access to social services. 
3) There was some feeling among Syrians that the guards in UNHCR do not always treat them with 
dignity. This has since been addressed through further training. 
4) Inadequate provision of services provided by UNHCR. They stated that they learnt that when they 
register with UNHCR, they are provided with core relief items which are not their primary need, so 
why register? 


Regarding males over 60 years, some are registered with UNHCR while others are not. Those who are 
not gave the following reasons from abstaining: 

 

1) Lack of money for transportation to UNHCR even for those who live in Amman costs are high. 
2) Fear for the same reasons mentioned above. 
3) Lack of information on UNHCR and its role. 


The majority of females over 60 years did not register with UNHCR and for the same reasons 
provided by other different groups. 

9.1.1. Conclusions 
1) All key informants who were interviewed in the different Governorates confirmed that Syrians in 
Jordan feel safe and protected. 
2) There appears to be common reasons among all the participants from the different age groups for 
their reluctance to register with UNHCR which can be summed up as lack of information about 
UNHCR and its mandate. This lack of knowledge was a fertile soil for rumours to be developed and 
fear to grow. Syrians think that UNHCR will share their profiles with the Syrian government and 
that if they register with the organization, they cannot exercise their right of voluntary repatriation. 
The Governor of Irbid said that Syrians do not register with UNHCR because they believe that they 
will go back to Syria very soon. 



3) The majority of Syrians believe that the services provided by the UNHCR are poor and provide no 
incentive to registration. Moreover, since the government of Jordan is hosting them with generosity 
they do not consider protection against non-refoulement a reason to register. This information was 
also confirmed by the key informants in Amman. 
4) The location of UNHCR registration premises in Amman is another reason to hinder registration 
even for Syrians who are residing in Amman. The location is too far and it costs a lot especially for 
big families which need more than one taxi for transportation. Most Syrians are not aware of the 
UNCHR help disk offices in Irbid, Ramtha, Mafraq. 
5) During the last two months, a number of these concerns have been addressed by the record numbers 
of Syrians approaching the Agency to register, with three times more registering than combined 
number for all of 2011. 
9.1.2. Recommendations 




1) It is recommended that UNHCR prepares an information dissemination strategy about its mandate, 
its help desk offices in other governorates and its services too. This strategy can combine various 
methodologies such as awareness raising focus group discussions, leaflets in the government 
hospitals and clinics. 
2) UNHCR is to reassess the appropriateness of its services to the Syrian population, and aim to better 
target its assistance strategy. 


9.2. Women Protection 

When asked about their safety in Jordan, the majority of the groups confirmed that women feel safe 
and protected and the only pressure and unsafe feelings they are facing are related to the factors that led 
them to come to Jordan. This was also confirmed by Key informants who stated that Syrian women are 
safe and protected in Jordan and that they didn’t witness or receive reports of any case of abuse including 
sexual abuse while in Jordan. 

 

Participants reported that they have heard of rape and abuse of women in Syria, where some were 
raped in front of their families which caused them chronic trauma. This was also reflected as one of the 
reasons for Syrians to leave their country. In one case mentioned a woman while kidnapped and held for a 
period of time, raped and abused badly. When she returned to her family her husband divorced her and 
she is mentally sick. Another case was mentioned by two groups about a pregnant woman that was 
kidnapped, raped and killed. 

 

Some participants confirmed that early marriage was more common prior to arriving to Jordan as part 
of the social culture of Syrians. However, one of the major problems that was highlighted by many Syrian 
women was the perception in Jordan that Syrian women are willing to marry for very little dowry. One 
mentioned an incident where a Syrian man after Friday prayers announced to the public that he was 
willing to let his five daughters marry good Jordanian men for nothing. It has to be noted that few 
documented marriages to Syrian women have taken place. 

 

Most women in the focus group discussions mentioned their discomfort about the way they are 
receiving aid and expressed concern and humiliation that they were photographed while receiving aid. 

9.3. Child Protection 

The assessment identified a range of child protection issues that children are currently exposed to in 
Jordan including child labor, and limited cases of unaccompanied and separated children. The assessment 
also identified diverse forms of conflict related violence and pre-existing child protection issues which 
children and families were exposed to in Syria. The child protection response in Jordan will need to 
provide services to children and families who experienced violence and other child protection issues in 
Syria. 

 


However, most participants reported that women and children did not experience sexual violence or 
abuse in Jordan and that they feel safe in Jordan. However, there were reported cases of sexual violence 
against children before they come to Jordan 

9.3.1. Early Marriage 




According to the personal status law in Syria that applies to Muslims, the eligible age of marriage is 
18 years for boys and 17 years for girls. A marriage below these ages can be authorized; for girls the 
minimum age is then 13 and for boys the minimum age is 15. (Source: Syria MENA Gender Equality 
Profile, UNICEF 2011). 

 

Early marriage in Syria was reported by all categories of respondents amongst both boys and girls 
including among girls as young as 13 and boys as young as 16. Most women claimed that early marriage 
was culturally accepted in Syria. They explained that the economic conditions of the girl’s family played 
a key role; when the family is poor they prefer to marry their daughters as soon as they get proposals from 
men from good families who can provide a good standard of living for their daughters. 

 

Early marriage of Syrian girls is a risk given the widespread acceptance of early marriage (under 
certain conditions) among the Syrian community. While these practices may in fact amount to a coping 
strategy by a number of Syrians households, they are not necessarily well perceived by everyone within 
the host communities including by Syrian males. 

 

 Respondents explained families were in fact trying to protect their daughters from an uncertain 
future by marrying them early. 

 

 A marriage below these ages can be authorized; for girls the minimum age is then 13 and for boys 
the minimum age is 15 (Source: Syria MENA Gender Equality Profile, UNICEF 2011). 

 

Only 3 cases of early marriage were reported in Jordan, all in Ramtha. These marriages occurred 
between Syrian girls aged 17 and 18 and Jordanian men. The family members reported that this 
happened in the ‘traditional way’ – that is, the family of the male proposed to the family of the girl 
following standard practice in Syria. 

9.3.2. Other forms of violence and exploitation especially against boys 






Most respondents indicated a lot of the children – mostly boys - were working in Syria mostly in the 
agriculture and building sectors, prior to fleeing. In Jordan, respondents reported that often children 
(again, mostly boys) are being encouraged to join the labor market by their parents and caregivers. 

 

An important proportion of adolescents (age 12-18) seems to have no other alternative than to work 
for long hours (between 10-12 hours on average a day), to meet their basic needs and those of their 
relatives. They are generally working in grocery shops where they carry boxes of goods and organize 
them on shelves. Some are waiters in cafes, others selling in vegetable stalls in markets. They are also 
working in physically demanding jobs in the construction industry. In Zarqa in particular, most of the 
youth are working with their families in tiling without receiving any remuneration. 

 

Some of the reasons given were that it is easier for children to find a job or that parents/adults cannot 
work due to sickness or that fathers do not wish to work due to either the low wages offered, bad 
conditions or because they would not get financial donations from rich individuals if they are working. 
Some of the children working are as young as 12 years old. 

 

Working conditions appear to be sometimes exploitative with children said to be working) for 
minimal wages (US$3-4 /day). Some of the businesses children are working in include barber shops, 
porters, coffee shops, furniture shops, construction/tiling workshops, and electricity workshops. 

 

In all six areas, several children and adults reported that children were being harassed verbally and 
called names (refugees, displaced, etc,..) by other students at schools. 


9.3.3. Unaccompanied or separated children 






Participants reported a few cases of children arriving in Jordan unaccompanied – most of these 
children subsequently were reunited with relatives or neighbors but some remain separated from their 
parents and thus in need for support. In addition, several respondents, especially middle-age women from 
Damascus and Aleppo reported that Mosques and Churches in these 2 cities have been looking after 
children as young as a few weeks and that religious leaders/personnel in Syria tried to place these 
children in families who can look after them. 

9.3.4. Conclusion 






In general, children reported feeling safe and protected in Jordan - as such the protection risks need to 
be seen in the context of the overall protection environment for Syrian children and families in Jordan. 
Children in Jordan are currently exposed to the following child protection risks: child labor, especially for 
adolescent boys; increased levels of domestic violence as a result of the stress among breadwinners 
(mostly male) in the family, and verbal abuse in schools. There are in addition, a limited number of 
mostly adolescent boys who are unaccompanied or separated. 

 

However, children and families arriving in Jordan report having experienced widespread violence in 
Syria - the victims of these various forms of violence will need support and services to recover. Through 
the assessment it was clear that many participants wanted and needed to talk about their experiences, but 
were hesitant to be referred to formal services. As such, building trust and encouraging but not forcing 
children and families who were victims of violence to access services such as psychosocial support, 
health, education and where appropriate, legal services, and helping communities to understand and 
support each other in dealing with these problems of children will be important. The same applies to 
children who had experienced non-conflict related child protection problems in Syria such as early 
marriage. Strong existing child protection services should be supported to scale up and adapt their 
services to the child protection issues facing Syrian children. 

9.3.5. Recommendations 




1) Provide financial and in-kind assistance in close coordination with Government to vulnerable 
families to prevent further child protection issues to respond to child protection issues such as child 
labor. 
2) Strengthen the national monitoring and reporting mechanisms to include the Syrian community. 
3) Strengthen the role of the Family Protection Directorate to respond and deal with Syrian cases of 
violence & abuse. 
4) Conduct an awareness campaign for the Syrian and host community on different protection issues 
including expanding the better parenting program to raise the awareness of Syrian parents & 
caregivers on child rearing practices and protection issues. 
5) Strengthen the psychosocial support programs targeting all age groups of Syrian community who 
were subjected to any form of violence, abuse or torture. 
6) To create child and adolescent friendly spaces for Syrian boys & girls especially those who have 
been exposed to child protection issues. 
7) Strengthen the referral system to meet the needs of the Syrian community 
8) Address the root causes of child labour by offering assistance programmes to the families who are 
sending their young children to schools and monitor their regular attendance. 
9) Provide support to the Ministry of Labour and enhance the role of inspectors to impose the law to 
prevent child labour. 



9.4. Domestic Violence 

Key Informants indicated that they did not receive reports of any case of domestic violence, and here 
was a consensus among all participants that there is no domestic violence of any kind. However, Syrian 
women believe that their male family members are under stress and this may lead them to be aggressive 
inside the household. 

9.3.6. Conclusions 




1) Women do feel safe and protected while in Jordan. 
2) Cases of sexual violence and rape while in Syria were reported and victims face trauma and need 
health care and psychosocial support and follow up. 
3) Syrian women justify domestic violence they face from male members given the pressures that they 
are facing. 
9.3.7. Recommendations 




1) Support to the Ministry of Social Development and the Family Protection Department to deal with 
cases of domestic violence among Syrians. 
2) Need for psychosocial support to women who were subjected to Sexual and Gender Based Violence 
(SGVB) before coming to Jordan. 
3) Future activities targeting women, especially young women, have to ensure they are provided in a 
place considered safe from the Syrian women’s perspective. 
4) Awareness raising is needed targeting Syrian women on domestic violence, their rights and 
available services in Jordan, and awareness raising is needed targeting Syrian men on domestic 
violence and stress management. 
5) NGOs to work on raising the awareness of Syrian and hosting communities on the early marriage 
issues and relevant Jordanian laws. 
6) Raising awareness of aid providers on standards and codes of conduct in aid provision in line with 
local cultures. 



10. GAPS AND IMMEDIATE NEEDS 

10.1. Syrians between 13 and 24 years 

1) Agreed that house rent was considered to be their first priority in Jordan, followed by food, phone 
calls to Syria and health. Education was not considered a priority in this category. 
2) Suggested replacing part of the food packages with financial assistance to support them in paying 
the rent and in purchasing food items which suit their diet. 
3) Talked about their need for in-kind items such as a refrigerator especially since the summer season 
is approaching and it will be difficult to save food in the hot temperature. 
4) Some expressed their need for recreational activities such as Qur’an memorization and trips. They 
believe that organizations can target youth at the school-going age through these activities and 
encourage them on the importance of continuing education. 
5) Suggested that people involved in aid distribution are not Syrians (conflict of interest). 


10.2. Females 

When females in the same age group (13-24) were asked about their priorities, there was consensus 
about the following order with some exceptions as stated below: 

 

1) Rent. 
2) Pocket money. 
3) Heath services. 
4) Food. 
5) Education. 


 However, participants in Irbid considered education as their first priority. Mothers considered 
health services as their first priority. Some participants gave high priority to work opportunities as these 
could secure reasonable levels of living conditions. 

 

The female groups suggested the following: 

1) Rent: if UNHCR can secure free residence or housing allowance. Moreover, they proposed that 
assistance should include water and electricity bills. 
2) Income: provide their husbands with work opportunities based on their qualifications. 
3) Change the type of heaters provided to them. The current one (kerosene) causes asthma problems 
among their children. 
4) Health awareness sessions. 
5) Food: they suggested to include more food varieties and include items for babies such as milk and 
to increase the quantity of items to match the number of family members. Participants in Amman 
suggested ensuring the sustainability of this assistance because they cannot afford buying food 
items. Participants in Zarqa suggested substituting this service with cash and those in Irbid 
suggested dividing this assistance into two parts: cash and food. 
6) Education: participants mentioned the need of their children for remedial classes as the Jordanian 
curriculum is more difficult than the Syrian one. They also suggested organising recreational 
activities which can help Syrians to meet Jordanians and increase the harmony within the two 
communities. 
7) Some suggested literacy classes. 



10.3. Males (25 - 60) 

Males between (25- 60) prioritized: rent, food and health. But they expressed a deep need for a 
steady income either through being helped to cover the cost of issuing work permits and secure 
employment opportunities, or through financial assistance. 

There was a consensus among the females on the following priorities: 

1) Rent and necessary or basic home furniture and appliances (refrigerators, washing machines, fans 
and cooker). 
2) Income can be in different forms: work opportunities or financial assistance. 




Priorities differed according to the city in which they live in: 

 

Amman: 

1. Awareness of available services. 
2. Awareness of UNHCR mandate. 
3. House utilities. 
4. Medical services. 
5. Education services. 


 

Al-Mafraq: 

1. Rent fees. 
2. House furniture and basic appliances. 
3. Clothes. 
4. Education services. 
5. Food. 
6. Health services. 
7. Coordination between the different existing organisations. 


 

Al-Ramtha: 

1. Rent fees. 
2. Household appliances. 
3. Financial assistance. 
4. Health services. 


 

Irbid: 

1. Rent fees. 
2. House furniture and appliances. 
3. Education services. 
4. Health services. 
5. Financial assistance instead of food packages and in-kind assistance. 


 

Zarqa: 

1. Rent fees and water and electricity bills. 
2. Financial assistance. 
3. Diapers. 
4. Health services. 


10.4. Males over 60 years old 

Males over 60 years old listed their needs as the following: 

1. Rent fees. 
2. Health services. 
3. Job opportunities. 
4. House furniture and appliances. 
5. Food. 



 

They meet part of these needs through sharing the expenses with other families and from assistance 
provided from the different organizations. They believe that they need financial aid as soon as possible to 
meet these needs. 

10.5. Females over 60 years old 

The older female participants indicated the below priorities: 

 

Zarqa: 

1. Separate accommodation, refrigerators. 


 

Irbid: 

1. Rent fees: Cash assistance to meet expenses which are not covered by the assistance provided by 
different organisations and individuals. In addition, household appliances. 


 

Ramtha: 

1. Education: Some female participants expressed that education is their priority because the 
organisations are providing them with rent fees. 
2. Cash assistance: They added that cash assistance was one of their priorities. 
3. Special equipment: Some of the participants indicated that older persons need special equipment 
such as medical beds and wheel chairs. 




 

They stated that they are completely dependent on charity organisations to meet their needs. They 
concluded the focus group discussion by saying that the financial assistance is the best mechanism to help 
them live in dignity and prioritise their needs. 

10.6. Conclusions 

1) Rent is the priority for all participants from different age groups, followed by food and other 
services such as education and health. It is also noted that Syrians prioritise their needs according to 
assistance provided in different governorates, hence the difference in priorities especially in 
Ramtha. 
2) The different Governors and key informants interviewed during this exercise confirmed that rent is 
the first priority for Syrians. The Governor of Irbid said that some Syrians are coping with their 
financial needs until now, but if the crisis continues they will need more material and financial 
assistance. 


10.7. Recommendations 

1) Financial assistance should be considered in a timely manner. This assistance will allow Syrians to 
prioritise their needs in a dignified manner. Criteria for providing financial assistance should be 
agreed upon by the Government. 
2) In case the government of Jordan decides to allow Syrians to occupy jobs that are restricted for non-
Jordanians, then the international community should pay the fees for issuing work permits for those 
workers. 
3) Awareness sessions on vaccination and women reproductive health in public health centres. 
4) A robust scheme to cover accommodation costs is needed. 


 


11. SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE 

11.1. Male participants (13-24) 

The male participants (13-24) summarized the assistance provided by the government in the medical 
and educational services. Some said that they can receive primary health care free of charge. Concerning 
assistance from other organizations some mentioned that they have received in-kind assistance from 
UNHCR. All of the participants said that they received in a regular manner food parcels from charity 
organizations. Participants shared the following on the distribution of in-kind assistance: 

 

1) Some accused a number of charity organizations of not delivering ALL assistance they receive. 
They also talked about favoritism. 
2) The size of food parcels does not match the number of family members. They have the same 
quantity regardless of how big or small is the family. 
3) Distribution can be humiliating when it takes place in the streets, sometimes the organizers do not 
take into consideration the importance of dignity when they organize the distribution methodology. 
4) Children needs are not taken into consideration. They need milk and diapers, items which are not 
distributed. 
5) In-kind assistance such as blankets and mattresses do not match the family member’s number. 


11.2. Female Participants (13-24) 

The females in this age group said that they received assistance from all regions. The different 
organisations provide different forms of support including; part of the rent, food parcels and in-kind 
assistance. 

 

The participants said that their neighbours and friends Jordanians or Syrians provided them with in-
kind donations such as kitchen kits and washing machines. 

 

Females in Mafraq reported injustice and favouritism in assistance distribution. They pointed out that 
Syrian fleeing Aleppo and Homs are prioritised. 

11.3. Male Participants (25-60) 

Male participants 25-60 said that they did not receive direct assistance from the Jordanian 
government and that support only came from organizations and individuals in the form of partial rent 
assistance and in-kind donations. 

 

The participants confirmed that the assistance which Syrians received from Syrian friends and 
neighbors was not different from that of organizations and Jordanian individuals. 

11.4. Female Participants (25-60) 

Female participants 25-60 claim that they do not receive financial aid but in-kind donations from 
different organizations. 

 

They said that some individuals provide them with financial support without which they would have 
been living in more difficult conditions. They also talked about having received support from landlords 
and Syrian friends. 

 

It is worth mentioning that the participants in Irbid mentioned favouritism among charity 
organisations and complained regarding aid distribution mechanisms; stating that the process was 
humiliating, taking place in the streets in front of neighbours. 

 


11.5. Males Over 60 Years Old 

Males over 60 years old said that the government of Jordan does not provide assistance; however, 
females in the same age group in Ramtha and Irbid confirmed that they were able to use public health 
care centers and hospitals. 

 

Males and females agreed that they both receive in-kind donations from different organizations 
which also pay them part of the rent. 

 

Moreover, their views were the same in regard to receiving assistance from Jordanian and Syrian 
friends and landlords. 

11.6. Conclusions 

1) It seems that all participants received medical and educational assistance from the government of 
Jordan through access to services and not in financial form. This was confirmed by the Governors 
of Mafraq, Irbid and Zarqa. They said that the government of Jordan shared the electricity and 
water of Jordanian citizens with their Syrian brothers. The Governor in Irbid added that the 
government had granted free access to health services in Irbid for Syrians. 
2) It also appears that the questions regarding assistance were not clear since the word ‘assistance’ in 
the view of Syrians is associated with material support, and many participants stated that they did 
not receive assistance. One realised this issue when conducting a number of focus group discussion 
with older persons. The first answer they give to the question regarding the government support is 
negative but when it is explained to them that their grandchildren can go to schools without paying 
fees, they realise that this is considered assistance. 
3) One can also add that most of the Syrians in Jordan are receiving assistance through different 
channels; Syrian and Jordanian friends, neighbours, landlords, and other Jordanian individuals or 
gulf citizens. This was confirmed in all the interviews with key informants. 
4) It is vital to highlight the comments made by participants regarding distribution of aid through 
organisations. Most of the participants reported favouritism and undignified aid distribution 
strategies. 


11.7. Recommendations 

1) UNHCR staff members and its partners should contribute to raise the awareness of the registered 
Syrian population on types of assistance- those which are provided by the organisation and by the 
government. 
2) UNHCR has an Information Line for all persons of concern, along with a secure and confidential 
complaints box. 


 


12. ANNEXES 

12.1. Annex 1 Impact Hosting Syrians in Jordan - June 2012 

(According to the Government of Jordan) 

 

I. INTRODUCTION 

 

Jordan continues to play a crucial role as moderate and stable force in the region, and demonstrates 
an unwavering commitment towards achieving peace, stability and prosperity in the Middle East as a 
whole. The ongoing political instability in the region has had adverse effects on Jordan, and has taken a 
heavy toll on Jordan's social and economic situation. It has also led to additional pressures in addressing 
critical challenges inter alia high levels of poverty and unemployment, as well as making less financial 
resources available for capital investments needed projects in priority sectors. 

 

Jordan also continues to face critical fiscal, social and economic challenges, most importantly the 
high budget deficit, high levels of outstanding public debt, high levels of poverty and unemployment in 
addition to critical energy and water challenges. This affects the country's ability to sustain 
socioeconomic achievements, and move forward with its development plans, as the country is subject to 
energy and food price fluctuations underlining its complete reliance on imported energy resources, as 
well as wheat and grain needs. 

 

More constrains are expected as a result of the deteriorating conditions and the unrest in Syria, which 
resulted in an influx of Syrians and other nationalities to Jordan. Since the beginning of the crisis in Syria 
until early June 2012, more than 120,000 Syrians fled to Jordan. The majority are concentrated in the 
cities of Ramtha, Irbid and surrounding villages, Mafraq, Amman, Zarqa, in addition to Maan southern 
Jordan. 

 

Hosting thousands of Syrians in Jordan have been causing additional pressures on the Kingdom’s 
already scarce resources, particularly in the sectors of water, energy, health, and education, which require 
additional public spending to maintain the current quality of services in these key sectors. Hosting over 
120,000 Syrians is expected to cost the country about US$123 million annually to cover the increasing 
demand on basic services, in addition to US$46.07 million in the form of subsidies. Furthermore, if 
Syrians stay longer in Jordan, this would require additional capital expenditure in the amount of 
US$178.4 million. Accordingly, the total cost for hosting 120 thousand Syrians is around US$347.5 
million. 

 

Moreover, hosting a large number of displaced people in the country has indirect costs as well, 
including: depletion of resources, competition with Jordanian youth on limited job opportunities, and 
expansion of the informal sector in addition to other social effects. Jordan today provides free public 
education, health services, subsidized water, electricity and household gas, in addition to subsidized 
bread, as well as basic commodities to all the Syrians on its territory, helping the most vulnerable make 
ends meet. 

 

II. NUMBER OF SYRIANS ARRIVING TO JORDAN AND REGISTRATION WITH THE UNHCR 

 

The number of Syrians staying in Jordan since early 2011 up till early June has exceeded 120 
thousand. Moreover, UNHCR data indicates that the total number of registered Syrians with UNHCR in 
Jordan as of end of May 2012 reached 20,000 individuals. 

 

IV. JORDAN’S POLICY RESPONSES 

 

In spite of the persisting fiscal, economic and social challenges facing the Jordanian economy, the 
Government of Jordan has announced a number of measures to ease the burden and improve the living 
conditions of Syrians in Jordan, including allowing Syrian students to register at public schools. This has 


resulted in 7,376 Syrian students registering at public school system for the current academic year 2011-
2012. Moreover, the Ministry of Education is holding entry-level exams for students who were 
interrupted from their education, and do not have the necessary documentation to prove their education 
level. In addition, Syrian students are able to take advantage of the available illiteracy, health care and 
nutrition programs on an equal footing as Jordanian students, in addition to having access to vocational 
education. 

 

On another front, the Government of Jordan has undertaken a number of contingency measures to 
address any further mass movements of Syrian citizens and other nationalities into Jordan. Such measures 
include preparing transit centers in Mafraq and Ramtha Governorates (north of Jordan) to accommodate 
Syrians who have sought refuge in Jordan. 

 

V. ESTIMATED COST OF RECEIVING SYRIANS 

 

The cost borne by the Government of Jordan to establish transit centers exceeded US$2.3 million for 
the civil works (leveling, compacting and sloping works), providing electricity, and other services such as 
providing accommodation at the Al-Hussein Youth Center. 

 

The daily expenses of transit centers (including daily management) are large and the donors are 
requested to support the Government in providing the basic needs including the provision of 
infrastructural facilities such as health posts, schools, warehouses, in addition to providing family tents, 
plastic sheets, blankets, multi-purpose cooking stoves, and other non-food items (such as jerry cans, 
sleeping mats, plastic buckets, mattresses, and others). Moreover, Jordan counts on the donors support in 
ensuring steady supply of food, medicine, electricity, fuel, and other basic needs to these centers. 

 

A large number of Syrians, distributed in different areas, are imposing extra burden on the 
municipalities. Huge daily expenditures are borne by the municipalities to meet the daily services. 
According to the authorities in these areas, a significant pressure has occurred to continue providing 
services such as garbage collection, sanitation, electricity, water supply, and drinking water, as well as the 
necessary maintenance for equipment and vehicles. This also requires establishing new landfill areas with 
extra expenditures including generators, lights, vehicles, equipment, and new employees to be able to 
manage the huge wastes resulting from the new residents. 

 

Capital expenditures for these municipalities and the monthly running costs for such services are 
estimated around US$1.47 million. 

 

a) Subsidized Commodities 




Syrians in Jordan benefit from a number of items and commodities that are subsidized by the 
Government of Jordan in order to ease the burden on citizens in the country. Among the subsidized items 
are bread, cooking gas cylinders, fuel, electricity, and water. Receiving 120 thousand Syrians requires an 
increase in the allocations to subsidize the commodities and items which are considered as basic needs for 
the population. The table below shows that more than US$46 million is the additional amount needed to 
provide the subsidized items to Syrians:

b) Capital Expenditures 




 

In case of a prolong satay of Syrians in Jordan, and due to the increasing demand on services, the 
Government will face a pressing need for some projects that will increase the pressure on the budget to 
allocate money under capital expenditures as follows: 
(US$ million)

1.4 million/ 25 thousand citizens 

Total 

178.4 million 



 

c) Energy 




 

Jordan spent about US$5.6 billion to cover fuel and energy needs in 2011, particularly due to the 
shift to heavy fuel for electricity generation as a result of the interruption of the supply of Egyptian gas 
(13 times since February 2011) to the Kingdom, which is the main source of fuel for electricity 
generation. Jordan energy bill has increased by more than half in year 2011. The Government subsidized 
electricity and fuel during 2011 to cover the increasing demand on the energy sector with an amount of 
US$1.2 billion and US$773.5 million respectively. To cover the supply of energy for 120 thousands 
Syrians the budget bears around US$38.3 annually (US$318,775/1,000 Syrians). 

 

Further capital expenditures are needed to be capable to maintain the level of energy services 
provided by the Government. According to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, US$ 1 million 
needed to generate one megawatt of energy. 120 thousand Syrians need US$50.6 million (each 
1,000/US$421,666). 

 

d) Water 




 

Water shortage has become of permanent nature in Jordan and meeting water demands is a critical 
challenge. Jordan has reached a water crisis juncture that is expected to deepen; as present water use 
already exceeds the renewable freshwater resources by more than 20 percent. Jordanian's share of fresh 
water per year at less than 145 cubic meters, compared to global poverty line of water of 500 cubic meters 
while the world average is 4,000 cubic meters, which places serious constraints on the country’s overall 
development process. The Government of Jordan maintains high levels of subsidies in water sector and 
the public water services that are provided by the Water Authority of Jordan. 

 

According to the Ministry of Water and Irrigation, the capital expenditures and running costs paid 
during the period March 2011 until March 2012 to the sites where the Syrians are located in Jordan were 
around US$30 million (US$273,882/1000 Syrians). 

 

e) Education 




 

The number of Syrian students enrolled at public schools for the current academic year reached 
7,376. Each student costs the Government around US$847 annually (school renting, remedial classes, 
school fees and textbooks, liaison officers, furnishing, and recruiting new teachers), whereas the cost of 
accommodating 7,376 students at public schools reached US$6.25 million. The increasing demand on 
public schools facilities and the overcrowded school system is hampering the on-going reform program 
and affecting the quality of education. It is also making it more difficult for the Government to continue 
with its plans to eliminate the double-shift school system and stop renting school buildings. Furthermore, 
during 2011-2012 around 23 thousand students transferred from private schools to public school, as a 
result of the difficult economic situation, adding more pressure that needs to be accommodated. 

 

Based on the international standards, every 500 students need a new school. School construction 
costs around US$2.8 million. The cost of furnishing this school, printing text books, in addition to 
establishing and furnishing libraries and laboratories is estimated to reach US$48 thousand. Therefore, 


the total cost to accommodate 7,376 students through constructing 15 new schools is around US$41.7 
million. 

 

f) Health 




 

Health services are heavily subsidized by the Government, and more than 9 % of the public budget is 
allocated for the health sector. According to the international standards, 10 percentage of population 
receives tertiary health care, and 20 percentage receives primary health care (36 thousands Syrians out of 
120 thousands residing in Jordan), which costs in average around US$678 annually. Therefore, an 
estimated cost of 120 thousands is around US$24.4 million annually (US$678 thousands/1000 
individuals). The demand for health services is steadily increasing which requires us to bear an extra 
burden in this important sector. According to the standards, every 50 thousand citizens need one hospital 
with a capacity of 100 beds with an estimated cost of US$28 million to construct and equip one hospital. 
In addition to US$1.4 million to establish one comprehensive health center. Hence, in order to meet the 
health needs for a population of 120 thousand, there is a need to invest in US$63 million to construct two 
hospitals and five comprehensive health centers. 

 

g) National Security 


. Public Security Directorate (PSD) 


A number of security measures have been undertaken by the PSD since the beginning of the crises in 
March 2011. These measures have incurred an additional burden that caused further expenditures to meet 
the huge influx of Syrians into Jordan, through deploying extra security forces (policemen, vehicles, and 
equipment). According to the PSD, an amount of US$11.7 million was spent during the period March 
2011 until March 2012 for this purpose. 

 

. Civil Defence and Border Security Measures 


Jordan Civil Defence has played a key role in providing emergency services to the needed Syrians 
arriving to Jordan. Civil Defence also has installed a number of civil defence unites to provide the 
required services in the cities and villages with a concentration of Syrians, in addition to the border 
centers and security measures undertaken. The direct and indirect cost is estimated to reach US$8.3 
million annually. 

 

Additionally, indirect costs were incurred due to receiving Syrians. Sectors of food, water, electricity, 
road maintenance, and energy have been heavily affected, which increased the burdens on the budget and 
decreased the financial, social, and accommodations capacities of the hosting community. Syrians are 
arriving to the Kingdom with no money, no jobs, and no accommodation. This has led to escalating 
houses’ rents, in addition to competing with local citizens on the limited job opportunities. Cheap Syrian 
labor is preferable to the employers. They work for long hours and paid low wages. Furthermore, hosting 
thousands of Syrians requires adequate security measures to keep the societies monitored and safe. 


 

Accordingly, the Government of Jordan estimates show that hosting over 120,000 Syrians is 
expected to cost the country about US$347.5 million, out of which US$123 million needed annually to 
cover the increasing demand on basic services, US$46.07 million in the form of subsidies. And, if Syrians 
stay for a longer time, US$178.4 million are needed for capital expenditures, as stated in the table below

 1. The international community should provide 
support to the government of Jordan to be able to continue 
subsidizing the basic needs and commodities and 
providing the services needed for all i.e. education, health, 
energy, and others. This will help the Government to give 
Syrians access to the Jordanian medical services and 
continue providing access to Syrian children to its public 
schools.

2. To consider the possibility of providing monthly 
cash assistance to vulnerable Syrians in Jordan according 
to a criteria agreed upon with the Government. Financial 
assistance is considered a main protection tool which 
avoids opting for illegal work, exposure to exploitation 
and other negative coping mechanisms. The financial 
assistance seeks to protect Syrians’ dignity since the 
assistance can be based on their needs which they 
themselves prioritize and it can be brought to them- 
through ATM cards- in a more dignified manner than in-
kind assistance.

Concept Note 

Rapid joint needs assessment of Syrians in Jordan 

March 2012 

 

Background 

 

Since March 2011 the conflict in Syria has resulted in movement of thousands of Syrian nationals to 
Jordan who are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance across the country with concentrations in six 
governorates: Amman, Irbid, Mafra’a, Zarqa, Jarash and Ma’an. The GOJ announced some 85 thousand 
Syrians who crossed the borders and stayed in the country, although not all of these would be considered 
POC i.e. in need of humanitarian assistance. 

 

Following consultations between the GOJ (Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation- 
MOPIC and the Department of Statistics- DOS) and UN agencies, it was agreed to carry out a rapid needs 
assessment to inform on the immediate needs of POCs. For that purpose, assessment task force was 
convened by MOPIC consisting of MOPIC, DOS, JHCO, UNHCR, WFP, UNICEF, UNFPA, UNESCO 
and WHO which agreed on the following: 

 

Objectives 

 

The general objective of the assessment is to take stock of the needs of POCs who arrived in Jordan 
as a result of the unrest that started in Syria in March last year in order to better inform the response 
options of the different stakeholders, covering the following sectors and issues: 

 

1) Living conditions (including shelter). 
2) Coping mechanisms (including external/ humanitarian support, income and expenditures 
including food) 
3) Protection 
4) Health 
5) Education 
6) Gaps and immediate needs 


 

Methodology: participatory assessments which consist of: 

 

1) Focus group discussions with 30 groups of ten participants each, i.e. a sample population of 
300, divided into six categories by age (youth 13-24, adults and elderly 60+ - the latter including persons 
with disabilities) and gender. 
2) Key informants meetings (Mayors and directors of Health, Social development, and 
Education Directorates in the targeted area). 
3) Secondary data review. 


 

To be conducted by six teams, each team consisting of 2 UN and 2 GOJ (DOS) staff. (i.e. 24 staff 
from UN and GOJ will be involved in the data collection after the training) 

 

Locations covered will be Amman, Irbid (including Ramtha), Mafraq, Zarqa, and Ma’an.
